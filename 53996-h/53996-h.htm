      Chapter I&mdash;THE FIRST GLIMPSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AVE you dined at
      Ranelagh lately?&rdquo; asked Norma Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been there in my life,&rdquo; replied Jimmie Padgate. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo;
       he added simply, &ldquo;I am not quite sure whether I know where it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours is the happier state. It is one of the dullest spots in a dull
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why on earth do people go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The enquiry was so genuine that Miss Hardacre relaxed her expression of
      handsome boredom and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we are all like the muttons of Panurge,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where one
      goes, all go. Why are we here to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To enjoy ourselves. How could one do otherwise in Mrs. Deering's house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have known her a long time, I believe,&rdquo; remarked Norma, taking the
      opportunity of directing the conversation to a non-contentious topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since she was in short frocks. She is a cousin of King's&mdash;that's the
      man who took you down to dinner&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
She nodded. &ldquo;I have known Mr. King
      many weary ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has never told me about you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him full in the face, with the stony calm of the fashionable
      young woman accustomed to take excellent care of herself. Her companion
      met her stare in whimsical confusion. Even so ingenuous a being as Jimmie
      Padgate could not tell a girl he had met for the first time that she was
      beautiful, adorable, and graced with divine qualities above all women, and
      that intimate acquaintance with her must be the startling glory of a
      lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had known you for ages,&rdquo; he replied prudently, &ldquo;I should have
      mentioned your name to Morland King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you such friends then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fast friends: we were at school together, and as I was a lonely little
      beggar I used to spend many of my holidays with his people. That is how I
      knew Mrs. Deering in short frocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's odd, then, that I have n't met you about before,&rdquo; said the girl,
      giving him a more scrutinising glance than she had hitherto troubled to
      bestow upon him. A second afterwards she felt that her remark might have
      been in the nature of an indiscretion, for her companion had not at all
      the air of a man moving in the smart world to which she belonged. His
      dress-suit was old and of lamentable cut; his shirt-cuffs were frayed; a
      little bone stud, threatening every moment to slip the button-hole,
      precariously secured his shirt-front. His thin, iron-grey hair was untidy;
      his moustache was ragged, innocent of wax or tongs or any of the
      adventitious aids to masculine adornment. His aspect gave the impression,
      if not of poverty, at least of narrow means and humble ways of life.
      Although he had sat next her at dinner, she had paid little attention to
      him, finding easier entertainment in her conversation with King on topics
      of common interest, than in possible argument with a strange man whom she
      heard discussing the functions of art and other such head-splitting
      matters with his right-hand neighbour. Indeed, her question about Ranelagh
      when she found him by her side, later, in the drawing-room was practically
      the first she had addressed to him with any show of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastened to repair her maladroit observation by adding before he could
      reply,&mdash;
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;That is rather an imbecile thing to say considering the
      millions of people in London. But one is apt to talk in an imbecile manner
      after a twelve hours' day of hard racket in the season. Don't you think
      so? One's stock of ideas gets used up, like the air at the end of a
      dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you keep your soul properly ventilated,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were, perhaps, not so arresting as the manner in which they were
      uttered. Norma Hardacre was startled. A little shutter in the back of her
      mind seemed to have flashed open for an elusive second, and revealed a
      prospect wide, generous, alive with free-blowing airs. Then all was dark
      again before she could realise the vision. She was disconcerted, and in a
      much more feminine way than was habitual with her she glanced at him
      again. This time she lost sight of the poor, untidy garments, and found a
      sudden interest in the man's kind, careworn face, and his eyes,
      wonderfully blue and bright, set far apart in the head, that seemed to
      look out on the world with a man's courage and a child's confidence. She
      was uncomfortably conscious of being in contact with a personality widely
      different from that of her usual masculine associates. This her training
      and habit of mind caused her to resent; despising the faint spiritual
      shock, she took refuge in flippancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear our Tobin tubes get choked up in London,&rdquo; she said with a little
      laugh. &ldquo;Even if they did n't they are wretched things, which create
      draughts; so anyway our souls are free from chills. Look at that woman
      over there talking to Captain Orton&mdash;every one knows he's
      paymaster-general. A breath of fresh air in Mrs. Chance's soul would give
      it rheumatic fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abominable slander falling cynically from young lips brought a look of
      disapproval into Jimmie Padgate's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say such things?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You know you don't believe them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe them,&rdquo; she replied defiantly. &ldquo;Why shouldn't one believe the
      bad things one hears of one's neighbours? It's a vastly more entertaining
      faith than belief in their virtues. Virtue&mdash;being its own reward&mdash;is
      deadly stale to one's friends and unprofitable to oneself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynicism seems cheap to-day,&rdquo; said Jimmie, with a smile that redeemed his
      words from impertinence. &ldquo;Won't you give me something of yourself a little
      more worth having?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma, who was leaning back in her chair fanning herself languidly,
      suddenly bent forward, with curious animation in her cold face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know who you are or what you are,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why should you
      want more than the ordinary futilities of after-dinner talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because one has only to look at you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to see that it must be
      very easy to get. You have beauty inside as well as outside, and everybody
      owes what is beautiful and good in them to their fellow-creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why. According to you, women ought to go about like mediaeval
      saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every woman is a saint in the depths of her heart,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an astonishing person,&rdquo; replied Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation ended there, for Morland King came up with Constance
      Deering: he florid, good-looking, perfectly groomed and dressed, the type
      of the commonplace, well-fed, affluent Briton; she a pretty, fragile
      butterfly of a woman. Jimmie rose and was led off to another part of the
      room by his hostess. King dropped into the chair Jimmie had vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you have been sampling my friend Jimmie Padgate. What do you make
      of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just told him he was an astonishing person,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Jimmie! He's the best fellow in the world,&rdquo; said King, laughing.
      &ldquo;A bit Bohemian and eccentric&mdash;artists generally are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's an artist?&rdquo; inquired Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He just manages to make a living by it, poor old chap! He has never come
      off, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another neglected genius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that,&rdquo; replied Morland King in a matter-of-fact way,
      not detecting the sneer in the girl's tone. &ldquo;I don't think he's a great
      swell&mdash;I'm no judge, you know. But he has had a bad time. Anyway, he
      always comes up smiling. The more he gets knocked the more cheerful he
      seems to grow. I never met any one like him. The most generous,
      simple-minded beggar living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be wonderful to make you enthusiastic,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at him now, talking to the Chance woman as if she were an angel of
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma glanced across the room and smiled contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems to like it. She's preening herself as if the wings were already
      grown. Connie,&rdquo; she called to her hostess, who was passing by, &ldquo;why have
      you hidden Mr. Padgate from me all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butterfly lady laughed. &ldquo;He is too precious. I can only afford to give
      my friends a peep at him now and then. I want to keep him all to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fluttered away. Norma leaned back and hid a yawn with her fan; then,
      rousing herself with an effort, made conversation with her companion.
      Presently another man came up and King retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it getting on?&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Deering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, steady,&rdquo; he replied with his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland King shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;The only thing against it is papa
      and mamma&mdash;chiefly mamma. A Gorgon of a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll never get a wife to do you more credit than Norma. With that face
      I wonder she is n't a duchess by now. There <i>was</i> a duke once, but a
      fair American eagle came and swooped him off under Norma's nose. You see,
      she's not the sort of girl to give a man much encouragement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't stand a woman who throws herself at your head,&rdquo; said King,
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a funny way men have nowadays of confessing to the tender passion!&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Deering, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have a fellow do?&rdquo; he asked.
    &ldquo;Spout blank verse about the stars and things, like a Shakespearean hero?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be prettier, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you will have it, I'm about as hard hit as a man ever was&mdash;there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm delighted to hear it,&rdquo; said his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short while afterwards the dinner-party broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether you care to mix with utter worldlings like us, Mr.
      Padgate,&rdquo; said Norma, as she bade him good-bye, &ldquo;but we are always in on
      Tuesdays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tie him hand and foot and bring him,&rdquo; said King. &ldquo;Good-night, old
      chap. I'm giving Miss Hardacre a lift home in the brougham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Jimmie could say yes or no, they were gone. He found himself the
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certainly not going for another hour, Jimmie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Deering,
      as he came forward to take leave. &ldquo;You will sit in that chair and smoke
      and tell me all about yourself and make me feel good and pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he assented, laughing. &ldquo;Turn me out when it's time for me to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been the customary formula between them for many years; for Jimmie
      Padgate lacked the sense of time and kept eccentric hours, and although
      Connie Deering delighted in her rare confidential chats with him, a woman
      with a heavy morrow of engagements must go to bed at a reasonable period
      of the night. She was a woman in the middle thirties, a childless widow
      after a brief and almost forgotten married life, rich, pleasure-loving, in
      the inner circle of London society, and possessing the gayest, kindest,
      most charitable heart in the world. Her friendship with Norma Hardacre had
      been a thing of recent date.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had cultivated it first on account of her cousin Morland King; she had
      ended in enthusiastic admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is awfully good of you,&rdquo; she said, when they were comfortably settled
      down to talk, &ldquo;to waste your time with my unintelligent conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no such thing as unintelligent conversation,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a man like you there must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could hold an intelligent conversation with a rabbit,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma Hardacre, on arriving home, entered the drawing-room, where her
      mother was reading a novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma threw her white silk cloak over the back of a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connie sent her love to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you have to say?&rdquo; asked her mother, sharply. She was a faded
      woman who had once possessed beauty of a cold, severe type; but the years
      had pinched and hardened her features, as they had pinched and hardened
      her heart. Her eyes were of that steel grey which the light of laughter
      seldom softens, and her smile was but a contraction of the muscles of the
      lips. Even this perfunctory tribute to politeness which had greeted
      Norma's entrance vanished at the second question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morland King drove me home. What a difference there is between a private
      brougham and the beastly things we get from the livery-stable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has said nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. I should have told you if he had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose fault is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma made a gesture of impatience. &ldquo;My fault, if you like. I don't lay
      traps to catch him. I don't keep him dangling about me, and I don't
      flatter his vanities or make appeal to his senses, I suppose. I can't do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't behave like a fool, Norma,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, rapping her book
      with a paper-knife. &ldquo;You have got to marry him. You know you have. Your
      father and I are coming to the end of things. You ought to have married
      years ago, and when one thinks of the chances you have missed, it makes
      one mad. Here have we been pinching and scraping&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And borrowing and mortgaging,&rdquo; Norma interjected.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;&mdash;to give you a
      brilliant position,&rdquo; Mrs. Hardacre continued, unheeding the interruption,
      &ldquo;and you cast all our efforts in our teeth. It's sheer ingratitude. Why
      you threw over Lord Wyniard I could never make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to forget that, after all, there is a physical side to
      marriage,&rdquo; said Norma, with a little shudder of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate indelicacy in young girls,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, freezingly. &ldquo;One
      would think you had been brought up in a public house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us avoid indelicate subjects,&rdquo; retorted Norma, opening the first
      book to her hand. &ldquo;Where is papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how should I know?&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, irritably.
</p>
    <p>
There was silence.
      Norma pretended to read, but her thoughts, away from the printed lines,
      caused her face to harden and her lips to curl scornfully. She had been
      used to such scenes with her mother ever since she had worn a long frock,
      and that was seven years ago, when she came out as a young beauty of
      eighteen. The story of financial embarrassment had lost its fine edge of
      persuasion by overtelling. She had almost ceased to believe in it, and the
      lingering grain of credence she put aside with the cynical feeling that it
      was no great concern of hers, so long as her usual round of life went on.
      She had two hundred a year of her own, all of which she spent in dress, so
      that in that one particular at least, if she chose to be economical, she
      was practically independent. Money for other wants was generally
      procurable, with or without unpleasant dunning of her parents. She lived
      very little in their home in Wiltshire, a beautiful and stately young
      woman of fashion being a decorative adjunct to smart country-house
      parties. In London, if she sighed for a more extensive establishment and a
      more luxurious style of living, it was what she always had done. She had
      hated the furnished house or flat and the livery-stable carriage ever
      since her first season. In the same way she had always considered the
      omission from her scheme of life of a yacht and a villa at Cannes and
      diamonds at discretion as a culpable oversight on the part of the Creator.
      But the sordid makeshift of existence to which she was condemned was not a
      matter of yesterday. In spite of the financial embarrassments of the
      maternal fable she had noticed no cutting down of customary expenditure.
      Her father still played the fool on the stock exchange, her mother still
      attired herself elaborately and disdained to eat otherwise than <i>à la
      carte</i> at expensive restaurants, and she, Norma, went whithersoever the
      smart set drifted her. She had nothing to do with the vulgarity of
      financial embarrassments.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the question of marriage she was as fully determined as her mother
      that she should make a brilliant match. She had had two or three
      disappointments&mdash;the unwary duke, for instance. On the other hand she
      had refused eligibles like Lord Wyniard out of sheer caprice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only man who had given her a moment's stir of the pulses, a moment's
      thought of throwing her cap over the windmills, was a young soldier in the
      Indian Staff Corps. But he belonged to her second season, before she had
      really seen the world and grasped the inner meaning of life. Besides, her
      mother had almost beaten her; and in an encounter between the dragon who
      guarded the gold of her daughter's affections and the young Siegfried, it
      was the hero that barely escaped destruction; he fled to India for his
      life. Norma lost all sight and count of him for three years. Then she
      heard that he had married a schoolfellow of hers and was a month-old
      father. It was with feelings of peculiar satisfaction and sense of
      deliverance that she sent her congratulations to him, her love to his
      wife, and a set of baby shoes to the child. She had cultivated by this
      time a helpful sardonic humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now Morland King, within reasonable distance of a proposal. Her
      experience detected the signs, although little of sentimentality had
      passed between them. He was young, as marrying men go&mdash;a year or two
      under forty&mdash;of good family, fairly good-looking, very well off, with
      a safe seat in Parliament being kept warm for him by a valetudinarian ever
      on the point of retirement. Norma meant to accept him. She contemplated
      the marriage as coldly and unemotionally as King contemplated the seat in
      Parliament. But through the corrupted tissue of her being ran one pure and
      virginal thread. She used no lures. She remained chastely aloof, the arts
      of seduction being temperamentally repugnant to her. Knowledge she had of
      good and evil (a euphemism, generally, for an exclusive acquaintance with
      the latter), and she was cynical enough in her disregard of concealment of
      her knowledge; but she revolted from using it to gain any advantage over a
      man. At this period of her life she set great store by herself, and though
      callously determined on marriage condescended with much disdain to be
      wooed. Her mother, bred in a hard school, was not subtle enough to
      perceive this antithesis. Hence the constant scenes of which Norma
      bitterly resented the vulgarity. &ldquo;We pride ourselves on being women of the
      world, mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but that does n't prevent our remembering that
      we are gentlefolk.&rdquo; Whereat, on one occasion, Mr. Hardacre, in his
      flustering, feeble way, had told Norma not to be rude to her mother, only
      to draw upon himself the vials of his wife's anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in now, during the silence that had fallen on the two women&mdash;a
      short, stout, red-faced man, with a bald head, and a weak chin, and a
      drooping foxy moustache turning grey. He was bursting with an interminable
      tale of scandal that he had picked up at his club&mdash;a respectable
      institution with an inner coterie of vapid, middle-aged dullards whose
      cackle was the terror of half London society. It is a superstition among
      good women that man is too noble a creature to descend to gossip. Ten
      minutes in the members' smoking-room of the Burlington Club would paralyse
      the most scandal-mongering tabby of Bath, Cheltenham, or Tunbridge Wells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were sure she was a wrong 'un from the first,&rdquo; he explained in a
      thick, jerky voice to his listless auditors. &ldquo;And now it turns out that
      she was in thick with poor Billy Withers, you know, and when Billy broke
      his neck&mdash;that was through another blessed woman&mdash;I'll tell you
      all about her by'm bye&mdash;when Billy broke his neck, his confounded
      valet got hold of Mrs. Jack's letters, and how she paid for 'em's the
      cream of the story&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need not have that now, Benjamin,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, with a warning
      indication that reverence was due to the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course that's the end of it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hardacre, in some
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Norma rose with a laugh of hard mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The valet entered the service of Lord Wyniard, and now there's a pretty
      little divorce case in the air, with Jack Dugdale as petitioner and Lord
      Wyniard as corespondent. Are n't you sorry, mother, I did n't marry
      Wyniard and reform him, and save society this terrible scandal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning from her disconcerted parents, Norma pulled back the thick
      curtains from the French window and opened one of the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing that for?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hardacre irritably, as the cold
      air of a wet May night swept through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to try to ventilate my soul,&rdquo; said Norma, stepping on to the
      balcony.

      inexplicable run on a particular number at the roulette-table, there often
      seems to be a run on some particular phenomenon thrown up by the wheel of
      daily life. Such a recurrent incident was the meeting of Norma and Jimmie
      Padgate during the next few weeks. She met him at Mrs. Deering's, she ran
      across him in the streets. Going to spend a weekend out of town, she found
      him on the platform of Paddington Station. The series of sheer
      coincidences established between them a certain familiarity. When next
      they met, it was in the crush of an emptying theatre. They found
      themselves blocked side by side, and they laughed as their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This seems to have got out of the domain of vulgar chance and become
      Destiny,&rdquo; she said lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indeed favoured by the gods,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't deserve their good will because you have never come to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie replied that he was an old bear who loved to growl selfishly in his
      den. Norma retorted with a reference to Constance Deering. In her house he
      could growl altruistically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She pampers me with honey,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you'll get nothing so Arcadian with us,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I
      can provide you with some excellent glucose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were moved a few feet forward by the crowd, and then came to a halt
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my ward, Miss Aline Marden,&rdquo; he said, presenting a pretty slip of
      a girl of seventeen, who had hung back shyly during the short dialogue,
      and looked with open-eyed admiration at Jimmie's new friend. &ldquo;That is how
      she would be described in a court of law, but I don't mind telling you
      that really she is my nurse and foster-mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl blushed at the introduction, and gave him an imperceptible twitch
      of the arm. Norma smiled at her graciously and asked her how she had liked
      the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was heavenly,&rdquo; she said with a little sigh. &ldquo;Did n't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma, who had characterised the piece as the most dismal performance
      outside a little Bethel, was preparing a mendacious answer, when a sudden
      thinning in the crush brought to her side Mrs. Hardacre, from whom she had
      been separated. Mrs. Hardacre inquired querulously for Morland King, who
      had gone in search of the carriage. Norma reassured her as to his ability
      to find it, and introduced Jimmie and Aline. Mr. Padgate was Mr. King's
      oldest friend. Mrs. Hardacre bowed disapprovingly, took in with a hard
      glance the details of Aline's cheap, homemade evening frock, and the
      ready-made cape over her shoulders, and turned her head away with a sniff.
      She had been put out of temper the whole evening by Norma's glacial
      treatment of King, and was not disposed to smile at the nobodies whom it
      happened to please Norma to patronise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last King beckoned to them from the door, and they crushed through the
      still waiting crowd to join him. By the time Jimmie Padgate and his ward
      had reached the pavement they had driven off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder if we can get a cab,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cab!&rdquo; cried the girl, taking his arm affectionately. &ldquo;One would think you
      were a millionaire. You can go in a cab if you like, but I'm going home in
      a 'bus. Come along. We'll get one at Piccadilly Circus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried him on girlishly, talking of the play they had just seen. It
      was heavenly, she repeated. She had never been in the stalls before. She
      wished kind-hearted managers would send them seats every night. Then
      suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did n't you tell me how beautiful she was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Hardacre. I think she is the loveliest thing I have ever seen.
      I could sit and look at her all day long. Why don't you paint her portrait&mdash;in
      that wonderful ivory-satin dress she was wearing to-night? And the diamond
      star in her hair that made her look like a queen&mdash;did you notice it?
      Why, Jimmie, you are not paying the slightest attention!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I could repeat verbatim every word you have said,&rdquo; he replied
      soberly. &ldquo;She is indeed one of the most beautiful of God's creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll paint her portrait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, deary,&rdquo; said Jimmie, &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile in the brougham King was giving Norma an account of Jimmie's
      guardianship. She had asked him partly out of curiosity, partly to provide
      him with a subject of conversation, and partly to annoy her mother, whose
      disapproving sniff she had noted with some resentment. And this in brief
      is the tale that King told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ten years ago, John Marden, a brother artist of Jimmie Padgate's,
      died penniless, leaving his little girl of seven with the alternative of
      fighting her way alone through an unsympathetic world, or of depending on
      the charity of his only sister, a drunken shrew of a woman, the wife of a
      small apothecary, and the casual mother of a vague and unwashed family.
      Common decency made the first alternative impossible. On their return to
      the house after the funeral, the aunt announced her intention of caring
      for the orphan as her own flesh and blood. Jimmie, who had taken upon
      himself the functions of the intestate's temporary executor, acquiesced
      dubiously. The lady, by no means sober, shed copious tears and a rich
      perfume of whisky. She called Aline to her motherly bosom. The child, who
      had held Jimmie's hand throughout the mournful proceedings, for he had
      been her slave and playfellow for the whole of her little life, advanced
      shyly. Her aunt took her in her arms. But the child, with instinctive
      repugnance to the smell of spirits, shrank from her kisses. The shrew
      arose in the woman; she shook her vindictively, and gave her three or four
      resounding slaps on face and shoulders. Jimmie leaped from his chair, tore
      the scared little girl from the vixen's clutches, and taking her bodily in
      his arms, strode with her out of the house, leaving the apothecary and his
      wife to settle matters between them. It was only when he had walked down
      the street and hailed a cab that he began to consider the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth am I to do with you?&rdquo; he asked whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small arms tightened round his neck. &ldquo;Take me to live with you,&rdquo;
       sobbed the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings we learn wisdom. So be it,&rdquo; said
      Jimmie, and he drove home with his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As neither aunt nor uncle nor any human being in the wide world claimed
      the child, she became mistress of Jimmie's home from that hour. Her
      father's pictures and household effects were sold off to pay his
      creditors, and a little bundle of torn frocks and linen was Aline's sole
      legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happened to look in upon him the evening of her arrival,&rdquo; said King, by
      way of conclusion to his story. &ldquo;In those days he managed with a charwoman
      who came only in the mornings, so he was quite alone in the place with the
      kid. What do you think I found him doing? Sitting cross-legged on the
      model-platform with a great pair of scissors and needles and thread,
      cutting down one of his own night garments so as to fit her, while the kid
      in a surprising state of <i>déshabillé</i> was seated on a table, kicking
      her bare legs and giving him directions. His explanation was that Miss
      Marden's luggage had not yet arrived and she must be made comfortable for
      the night! But you never saw anything so comic in your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back and laughed at the reminiscence, not unkindly. Mrs.
      Hardacre, bored by the unprofitable tale, stared at the dim streets out of
      the brougham window. Norma, on friendlier terms with King, the little
      human story having perhaps drawn them together, joined in the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, I suppose, when she grows a bit older, Mr. Padgate will marry
      her and she will be a dutiful little wife and they will live happy and
      humdrum ever after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will provide her with some decent rags to put on,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Hardacre. &ldquo;Those the child was wearing to-night were fit for a servant
      maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie would give her his skin if she could wear it,&rdquo; said Morland,
      somewhat tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This expression of feeling gave him, for the first time, a special place
      in Norma's esteem. After all, a woman desires to like the man who in a few
      months' time may be her husband, and hitherto Morland had presented a
      negativity of character which had baffled and irritated her. The positive
      trait of loyalty to a friend she welcomed instinctively, although if
      charged with the emotion she would have repudiated the accusation. When
      the carriage stopped at the awning and red strip of carpet before the
      house in Eaton Square where a dance awaited her, and she took leave of
      him, she returned his handshake with almost a warm pressure and sent him
      away, a sanguine lover, to his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Constance Deering, taking her on a round of shopping,
      enquired how the romance was proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has had me on probation,&rdquo; replied Norma, &ldquo;and has been examining all
      my points. I rather think he finds me satisfactory, and is about to make
      an offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an idyllic pair you are!&rdquo; laughed her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma took the matter seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is perfectly right. He is on the lookout for a woman who can keep
      up or perhaps add to his social prestige, who can conduct the affairs of a
      large establishment when he enters political life, who can possibly give
      him a son to inherit his estate, and who can wear his family diamonds with
      distinction&mdash;and it does require a woman of presence to do justice to
      family diamonds, you know. He looks round society and sees a girl that may
      suit him. Naturally he takes his time and sizes her up. I have learned
      patience and so I let him size to his heart's content. On the other hand,
      what he can give me falls above the lower limit of my requirements, and
      personally I don't dislike him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; cried Constance Deering, &ldquo;the man is head over ears in love
      with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I like him all the better for dissembling it so effectually,&rdquo; said
      Norma, &ldquo;and I hope he'll go on dissembling to the end of the chapter. I
      hate sentiment.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
They were walking slowly down Bond Street, and happened
      to pause before a picture-dealer's window, where a print of a couple of
      lovers bidding farewell caught Mrs. Deering's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call that pretty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you hate love too?&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
Norma twirled her
      parasol and moved away, waiting for the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love, my dear Connie, is an appetite of the lower middle classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Norma!&rdquo; the other exclaimed, &ldquo;I do wish Jimmie Padgate could hear
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma started at the name. &ldquo;What has he got to do with the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's one of his pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it?&rdquo; said Norma, indifferently. But feminine curiosity compelled a
      swift parting glance at the print.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine our guileless friend has a lot to learn,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;A few
      truths about the ways of this wicked world would do him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised to go and look round his studio to-morrow morning; will you
      come and give him his first lesson?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Deering, mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the destiny she had previously remarked upon seemed to be fulfilling
      itself. A day or two afterwards his familiar figure burst upon her at a
      Private View in a small picture-gallery. His eyes brightened as she
      withdrew from her mother, who was accompanying her, and extended her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, who would have thought of seeing you here? Do you care for
      pictures? Why have n't you told me? I am so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love of Art did n't bring me here, I assure you,&rdquo; replied Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie in his guilelessness had an uncomfortable way of posing fundamental
      questions. In that respect he was like a child. Norma smiled in silent
      contemplation of the real object of their visit. At first her mother had
      tossed the cards of invitation into the waste-paper basket. It was
      advertising impudence on the part of the painter man, whom she had met but
      once, to take her name in vain on the back of an envelope. Then hearing
      accidentally that the painter man had painted the portraits of many
      high-born ladies, including that of the Duchess of Wiltshire, and that the
      Duchess of Wiltshire herself&mdash;their own duchess, who gave Mrs.
      Hardacre the tip of her finger to shake and sometimes the tip of a rasping
      tongue to meditate upon, whom Mrs. Hardacre had tried any time these ten
      years to net for Heddon Court, their place in the country&mdash;had
      graciously promised to attend the Private View, in her character of Lady
      Patroness-in-Chief of the painter man, Mrs. Hardacre had hurried home and
      had set the servants' hall agog in search of the cards. Eventually they
      had been discovered in the dust-bin, and she had spent half an hour in
      cleansing them with bread-crumbs, much to Norma's sardonic amusement. The
      duchess not having yet arrived, Mrs. Hardacre had fallen back upon the
      deaf Dowager Countess of Solway, who was discoursing to her in a loud
      voice on her late husband's method of breeding prize pigs. Norma had
      broken away from this exhilarating lecture to greet Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his eager eyes upon her, still waiting for an answer to his
      question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma, fairly quick-witted, indicated the walls with a little
      comprehensive gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call this simpering, uninspired stuff Art?&rdquo; she said, begging the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's not that,&rdquo; cried Jimmie, falling into the trap. &ldquo;It's really
      very good of its kind. Amazingly clever. Of course it's not highly
      finished. It's impressionistic. Look at that sweeping line from the throat
      all the way down to the hem of the skirt,&rdquo; indicating the picture in front
      of them and following the curve, painter fashion, with bent-back thumb;
      &ldquo;how many of your fellows in the Academy could get that so clean and
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just met Mr. Porteous, who said he could n't stay any longer
      because such quackery made him sick,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie glanced round the walls. Porteous, the Royal Academician, was
      right. The colour was thin, the modelling flat, the drawing tricky, the
      invention poor. A dull soullessness ran through the range of full-length
      portraits of women. He realised, with some distress, the clever
      insincerity of the painting; but he had known Foljambe, the author of
      these coloured crimes, as a fellow-student at the Beaux-Arts in Paris, and
      having come to see his work for the first time, could not bear to judge
      harshly. It was characteristic of him to expatiate on the only merit the
      work possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Porteous even said,&rdquo; continued Norma, &ldquo;that it was scandalous such a
      man should be making thousands when men of genius were making hundreds. It
      was taking the bread out of their mouths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry he said that,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;I think we ought rather to be
      glad that a man of poor talent has been so successful. So many of them go
      to the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you always find the success of your inferior rivals so comforting?&rdquo;
       asked Norma. &ldquo;I don't.&rdquo; She thought of the depredatory American.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie pushed his hat to the back of his head&mdash;a discoloured Homburg
      hat that had seen much wear&mdash;and rammed his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's horrible to regard oneself and one's fellow-creatures as so many
      ghastly fishes tearing one another to pieces so as to get at the same
      piece of offal. That's what it all comes to, does n't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The picture of the rapt duke as garbage floating on the tide of London
      Society brought with it a certain humourous consolation. That of her own
      part in the metaphor did not appear so soothing. Jimmie's proposition
      being, however, incontrovertible, she changed the subject and enquired
      after Aline. Why had n't he brought her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid we should have argued about Foljambe's painting,&rdquo; said
      Jimmie, with innocent malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we should have agreed about it,&rdquo; replied Norma. She talked about
      Aline. Morland King had been tale-bearing. It was refreshing, she
      confessed, once in a way to hear good of one's fellow-creatures: like
      getting up at six in the morning in the country and drinking milk fresh
      from the cow. It conferred a sense of unaccustomed virtue. The mention of
      milk reminded her that she was dying for tea. Was it procurable?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a roomful of it. Can I take you?&rdquo; asked Jimmie, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She assented. Jimmie piloted her through the chattering crowd. On the way
      they passed by Mrs. Hardacre, still devoting the pearls of her attention
      to the pigs. She acknowledged his bow distantly and summoned her daughter
      to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you <i>affiché</i>-ing yourself with that nondescript man for?&rdquo;
       she asked in a cross whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma moved away with a shrug, and went with Jimmie into the crowded
      tea-room. There, while he was fighting for tea at the buffet, she fell
      into a nest of acquaintances. Presently he emerged from the crush
      victorious, and, as he poured out the cream for her, became the
      unconscious target of sharp feminine glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your friend?&rdquo; asked one lady, as Jimmie retired with the
      cream-jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will introduce him if you like,&rdquo; she replied. He reappeared and was
      introduced vaguely. Then he stood silent, listening to a jargon he was at
      a loss to comprehend. The women spoke in high, hard voices, with impure
      vowel sounds and a clipping of final consonants. The conversation gave him
      a confused impression of Ascot, a horse, a foreign prince, and a lady of
      fashion who was characterised as a &ldquo;rotter.&rdquo; Allusion was also made to a
      princely restaurant, which Jimmie, taken thither one evening by King,
      regarded as a fairy-land of rare and exquisite flavours, and the opinion
      was roundly expressed that you could not get anything fit to eat in the
      place and that the wines were poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie listened wonderingly. No one seemed disposed to controvert the
      statement, which was made by quite a young girl. Indeed one of her friends
      murmured that she had had awful filth there a few nights before. A smartly
      dressed woman of forty who had drawn away from the general conversation
      asked Jimmie if he had been to Cynthia yet. He replied that he very seldom
      went to theatres. The lady burst out laughing, and then seeing the genuine
      enquiry on his face, checked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were trying to pull my leg,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I mean
      Cynthia, the psychic, the crystal gazer. Why, every one is going crazy
      over her. Do you mean to say you have n't been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may scoff, but she's wonderful. Do you know she actually gave me the
      straight tip for the Derby? She did n't mean to, for she does n't lay
      herself out for that sort of thing&mdash;but she said, after telling me a
      lot of things about myself&mdash;things that had really happened&mdash;she
      was getting tired, I must tell you&mdash;'I see something in your near
      future&mdash;it is a horse with a white star on its forehead&mdash;it has
      gone&mdash;I don't know what it means.' I went to the Derby. I had n't put
      a cent on, as I had been cleaned out at Cairo during the winter and had to
      retrench. The first horse that was led out had a white star on his
      forehead. None of the others had. It was St. Damien&mdash;a thirty to one
      chance. I backed him outright for £300. And now I have £9000 to play with.
      Don't tell me there's nothing in Cynthia after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knot of ladies dissolved. Jimmie put Norma's teacup down and went
      slowly back with her to the main room. He was feeling depressed, having
      lost his bearings in this unfamiliar world. Suddenly he halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could pinch me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To test whether I am awake. Have I really heard a sane and educated lady
      expressing her belief in the visions of a crystal-gazing adventuress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have. She believes firmly. So do heaps of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to heaven you don't!&rdquo; he cried with a sudden intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What concern can my faith be to you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. No concern at all,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;But I
      generally blurt out what is in my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is in your mind? I am a person you can be quite frank with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could n't bear the poem of your life to be sullied by all these
      vulgarities,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I remarked to you the first evening I met you, Mr. Padgate,&rdquo; she said,
      holding out her hand by way of dismissal, &ldquo;you are an astonishing person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poem of her life! The phrase worried her before she slept that night.
      She shook the buzzing thing away from her impatiently. The poem of her
      life! The man was a fool.

      Chapter III&mdash;A MODERN BETROTHAL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> YOUNG woman bred
      to a material view of the cosmos and self-trained to cynical expression of
      her opinions may thoroughly persuade herself that marriage is a social
      bargain in which it would be absurd for sentiment to have a place, and yet
      when the hour comes for deciding on so trivial an engagement, may find
      herself in an irritatingly unequable frame of mind. For Norma the hour had
      all but arrived. Morland King had asked to see her alone in view of an
      important conversation. She had made an appointment for ten o'clock,
      throwing over her evening's engagements. Her parents were entertaining a
      couple of friends in somebody else's box at the opera, and would return in
      time to save the important conversation from over-tediousness. She
      intended to amuse herself placidly with a novel until King's arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a week or two after her encounter with Jimmie at the
      picture-gallery, since which occasion she had neither seen nor heard of
      him. He had faded from the surface of a consciousness kept on continued
      strain by the thousand incidents and faces of a London season. To Jimmie
      the series of meetings had been a phenomenon of infinite import. She had
      come like a queen of romance into his homely garden, and her radiance
      lingered, making the roses redder and the grass more green. But the
      queenly apparition herself had other things to think about, and when she
      had grown angry and called him a fool, had dismissed him definitely from
      her mind. It was annoying therefore that on this particular evening the
      fool phrase should buzz again in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw down her book and went on to the balcony, where, on this close
      summer night, she could breathe a little cool air. A clock somewhere in
      the house chimed the half-hour. Morland was to come at ten. She longed
      for, yet dreaded, his coming; regretted that she had stayed away from the
      opera, where, after all, she could have observed the everlasting human
      comedy. She had dined early; the evening had been interminable; she felt
      nervous, and raged at her weakness. She was tired, out of harmony with
      herself, fretfully conscious too of the jarring notes in a room furnished
      by uneducated people of sudden wealth. The Wolff-Salamons, out of the
      kindness of their shrewd hearts, had offered the house for the season to
      the Hardacres, who had accepted the free quarters with profuse
      expressions of gratitude; which, however, did not prevent Mr. Hardacre
      from railing at the distance of the house (which was in Holland Park) from
      his club, or his wife from deprecating to her friends her temporary
      residence in what she was pleased to term the Ghetto. Nor did the
      Wolff-Salamons' generosity mitigate the effect of their furniture on
      Norma's nerves. When Jimmie's phrase came into her head with the
      suddenness of a mosquito, she could bear the room no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat on the balcony and waited for Morland. There at least she was free
      from the flaring gold and blue, and the full-length portrait of the lady
      of the house, on which with delicate savagery the eminent painter had
      catalogued all the shades of her ancestral vulgarity. Perhaps it was this
      portrait that had brought back the irony of Jimmie's tribute. The poem of
      her life! She sat with her chin on her palm, thinking bitterly of
      circumstance. She had never been happy, had grown to disbelieve in so
      absurd and animal a state. It had always been the same, as far back as she
      could remember. Her childhood: nurses and governesses&mdash;a swift
      succession of the latter till she began to regard them as remote from her
      inner life as the shop girl or railway guard with whom she came into
      casual contact. The life broken by visits abroad to fashionable watering
      or gambling places where she wandered lonely and proud, neglected by her
      parents, watching with keen eyes and imperturbable face the frivolities,
      the vices, the sordidnesses, taking them all in, speculating upon them,
      resolving some problems unaided and storing up others for future
      elucidation. Her year at the expensive finishing school in Paris where the
      smartest daughters of America babbled and chattered of money, money, till
      the air seemed unfit for woman to breathe unless it were saturated with
      gold dust. As hers was not, came discontent and overweening ambitions. Yet
      the purity was not all killed. She remembered her first large
      dinner-party. The same Lord Wyniard of the unclean scandal had taken her
      down. He was thirty years older than she, and an unsavoury reputation had
      reached even her young ears. The man regarded her with the leer of a
      satyr. She realised with a shudder for the first time the meaning of a
      phrase she had constantly met with in French novels&mdash;&ldquo;<i>il la
      dévêtit de ses yeux</i>.&rdquo; His manner was courtly, his air of breeding
      perfect; yet he managed to touch her fingers twice, and he sought to lead
      her on to dubious topics of conversation. She was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room, seeing him approach, she lost her head, took shelter
      with her mother, and trembling whispered to her, &ldquo;Don't let that man come
      and talk to me again, mother, he's a beast.&rdquo; She was bidden not to be a
      fool. The man had a title and twenty thousand a year, and she had
      evidently made an impression. A week afterwards her mother invited a
      bishop and his wife and Lord Wyniard to dinner, and Lord Wyniard took
      Norma down again. And that was her start in the world. She had followed
      the preordained course till now, with many adventures indeed by the way,
      but none that could justify the haunting phrase&mdash;the poem of her
      life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the man such a fool, after all? Was it even ignorance on his part? Was
      it not, rather, wisdom on a lofty plane immeasurably above the
      commonplaces of ignorance and knowledge? The questions presented
      themselves to her vaguely. She was filled with a strange unrest, a craving
      for she knew not what. Yet she would shortly have in her grasp all&mdash;or
      nearly all&mdash;that she had aimed at in life. She counted the tale of
      her future possessions&mdash;houses, horses, diamonds, and the like. She
      seemed to have owned them a thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock in the house chimed ten in a pretentious musical way, which
      irritated her nerves. The silence after the last of the ten inexorable
      tinkles fell gratefully. Then she realised that in a minute or two Morland
      would arrive. Her heart began to beat, and she clasped her hands together
      in a nervous suspense of which she had not dreamed herself capable. A cab
      turned the corner of the street, approached with crescendo rattle, and
      stopped at the house. She saw Morland alight and reach up to pay the
      cabman. For a silly moment she had a wild impulse to cry to him over
      the balcony to go away and leave her in peace. She waited
      until she heard the footman open the front door and admit him, then
      bracing herself, she entered the drawing-room, looked instinctively in a
      mirror, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met him cordially enough, returned his glance somewhat defiantly. The
      sight of him, florid, sleek, faultlessly attired, brought her back within
      the every-day sphere of dulled sensation. He held her hand long enough for
      him to say, after the first greeting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can guess what I've come for, can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I do,&rdquo; she admitted in an off-hand way. &ldquo;You will find
      frankness one of my vices. Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She motioned him to a chair, and seating herself on a sofa, prepared to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come to ask you to marry me,&rdquo; said King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked, looking at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know how it strikes you,&rdquo; he continued after a brief pause. &ldquo;I
      think you know practically all that I can tell you about myself. I can
      give you what you want up to about fifteen thousand a year&mdash;it will
      be more when my mother dies. We're decent folk&mdash;old county family&mdash;I
      can offer you whatever society you like. You and I have tastes in common,
      care for the same things, same sort of people. I'm sound in wind and limb&mdash;never
      had a day's illness in my life, so you would n't have to look after a
      cripple. And I'd give the eyes out of my head to have you; you know that.
      How does it strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma had averted her glance from him towards the end of his speech, and
      leaning back was looking intently at her hands in her lap. For the moment
      she felt it impossible to reply. The words that had formulated themselves
      in her mind, &ldquo;I think, Mr. King, the arrangement will be eminently
      advantageous to both parties,&rdquo; were too ludicrous in their adequacy to the
      situation. So she merely sat silent and motionless, regarding her
      manicured finger-nails, and awaiting another opening. King changed his
      seat to the sofa, by her side, and leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had been a simpler, more unsophisticated girl, Norma, I should
      have begun differently. I thought it would please you if I put sentiment
      aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head motioned acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not going to put it aside,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It has got its place in
      the world, even when a man makes a proposal of marriage. And when I say
      I'm in love with you, that I have been in love with you since the first
      time I saw you, it's honest truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you have a regard, a high regard, even,&rdquo; said Norma, still not
      looking at him, &ldquo;and I'll believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm hanged if I will,&rdquo; said Morland. &ldquo;I say I'm in love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma suddenly softened. The phrase tickled her ears again&mdash;this time
      pleasantly. The previous half-hour's groping in the dark of herself seemed
      to have resulted in discovery. She gave him a fleeting smile of mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you will be contented with regard, a high regard,
      on my side, I will marry you. I really like you very much. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all I ask now. The rest will come by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so sure. We had better be perfectly frank with each other from
      the start, for we shall respect each other far more. Anyhow, if you treat
      me decently, as I am sure you will, you may be satisfied that I shall
      carry out my part of the bargain. My bosom friends tell one another that I
      am worldly and heartless and all that&mdash;but I've never lied seriously
      or broken a promise in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Let us leave it at that,&rdquo; said Morland. &ldquo;I suppose your people
      will have no objection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; replied Norma, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I announce our engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took two or three reflective steps about the room and reseated himself
      on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norma,&rdquo; he said softly, bending towards her, &ldquo;I believe on such occasions
      there is a sort of privilege accorded to a fellow&mdash;may I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him, hesitated, then proffered her cheek. He touched it
      with his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony over, there ensued a few minutes of anticlimax. Norma
      breathed more freely. There had been no difficulties, no hypocrisies. The
      mild approach to rapture on Morland's part was perhaps, after all, only a
      matter of common decency, to be accepted by her as a convention of the <i>scène
      à faire</i>. So was the kiss. She broke the spell of awkwardness by
      rising, crossing the room, and turning off an electric pendant that
      illuminated the full-length portrait on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't stand Mrs. Wolff-Salamon's congratulations so soon,&rdquo; she said
      with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation again became possible. They discussed arrangements. King
      suggested a marriage in the autumn. Norma, with a view to the prolongation
      of what appealed to her as a novel and desirable phase of existence&mdash;maidenhood
      relieved of the hateful duty of husband-hunting and unclouded by parental
      disapprobation&mdash;pleaded for delay till Christmas. She argued that in
      all human probability the Parliamentary vacancy at Cosford, the safe seat
      on which Morland reckoned, would occur in the autumn, and he could not fix
      the date of an election at his own good pleasure. He must, besides, devote
      his entire energy to the business; time enough when it was over to think
      of such secondary matters as weddings, bridal tours, and the setting up of
      establishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have to be considered, Norma,&rdquo; he said, half convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Morland,&rdquo; she replied with a derisive lip, &ldquo;I should never dream
      of coming between you and your public career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reflected a moment. &ldquo;Why should we not get married at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma laughed. &ldquo;You are positively pastoral! No, my dear Morland, that's
      what the passionate young lover always says to the coy maiden in the play,
      but if you will remember, it does n't seem to work even there. Besides,
      you must let me gratify my ambitions. When I was very young, I vowed I
      would marry an emperor. Then I toned him down into a prince. Later,
      becoming more practical, I dreamed of a peer. Finally I descended to a
      Member of Parliament. I can't marry you before you are a Member.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could have had dozens of 'em for the asking, I'm sure,&rdquo; returned the
      prospective legislator with a grin. &ldquo;Take them all round, they're a shoddy
      lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yielded eventually to Norma's proposal, alluding, however, with an air
      of ruefulness, to the infinite months of waiting he would have to endure.
      Tactfully she switched him off the line of sentiment to that of soberer
      politics. She put forward the platitude that a Parliamentary life was one
      of great interest. Morland did not rise even to this level of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pon my soul, I really don't know why I'm going in for it. I promised old
      Potter years ago that I would come in when he gave up, and the people down
      there more or less took it for granted, the duchess included, and so
      without having thought much of it one way or the other, I find myself
      caught in a net. It will be a horrible bore. The whole of the session will
      be one dismal yawn. Never to be certain of sitting down to one's dinner in
      peace and comfort. Never to know when one will have to rush off at a
      moment's notice to take part in a confounded division. To have shoals of
      correspondence on subjects one knows nothing of and cares less for. It
      will be the life of a sweated tailor. And I, of all people, who like to
      take things easy! I'm not quite sure whether I'm an idiot or a hero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ended in a short laugh and leaned against the mantelpiece, his hands in
      his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be the sweet and pretty thing for me to say,&rdquo; remarked Norma,
      &ldquo;that in my eyes you will always be heroic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, 'pon my soul, I shall be. We 'll see precious little of one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We 'll have all the more chance of prolonging our illusions,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, however, her conduct towards him was irreproachable. The
      thaw from her usual iciness to this comparatively harmless raillery
      flattered the lover's self-esteem. Woman-wise, as every man in the
      profundity of his vain heart believes himself to be, he not only
      attributed the change to his own powers of seduction, but interpreted as
      significant of a yet greater transformation. A man of Morland's type is
      seldom afflicted with a morbid subtlety of perception; and when he has
      gained for his own personal use and adornment a woman of singular
      distinction, he may be readily pardoned for a slight attack of fatuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idyllic hour was brought to a close by the return of Norma's parents.
      As Norma, shrinking from the vulgarity of the prearranged scene and
      intolerable maternal coaching in her part, had not informed them of her
      appointment with Morland, alleging as an excuse for not going to the opera
      a disinclination to be bored to tears by <i>Aida</i>, they were mildly
      surprised by his presence in the house at so late an hour. In a few words
      he acquainted them with what had taken place. He formally asked their
      consent. Mr. Hardacre wrung his hand fervently. Mrs. Hardacre's steel-grey
      eyes glittered welcome into her family. She turned to her dear child and
      expressed her heartfelt joy. Norma, submissive to conventional decencies,
      suffered herself to be kissed. Mother and daughter had given up kissing as
      a habit for some years past, though they practised it occasionally before
      strangers. Mr. Hardacre put his arm around her in a diffident way and
      patted her back, murmuring incoherent wishes for her happiness. Everything
      to be said and done was effected in a perfectly well-bred manner. Norma
      spoke very little, regarding the proceedings with an impersonal air of
      satiric interest. At last Mr. Hardacre suggested to Morland a chat over
      whisky and soda and a cigar in the library. In unsophisticated circles it
      is not unusual at such a conjuncture for a girl's friends and relations to
      afford the lovers some unblushing opportunity of bidding each other a
      private farewell. Norma, anticipating any such possible though improbable
      departure from sanity on the part of her parents, made good her escape
      after shaking hands in an ordinary way with Morland. Mrs. Hardacre
      followed her upstairs, eager to learn details, which were eventually given
      with some acidity by her daughter, and the two men retired below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Hardacre, as they parted an hour afterwards, &ldquo;you will
      find that Norma has had the training that will make her a damned fine
      woman.&rdquo;

      Chapter IV&mdash;THE GREAT FROCK EPISODE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>IMMIE PADGATE was
      the son of a retired commander in the Navy, of irreproachable birth and
      breeding, of a breezy impulsive disposition, and with a pretty talent as
      an amateur actor. Finding idleness the root of all boredom, he took to the
      stage, and during the first week of his first provincial tour fell in love
      with the leading lady, a fragile waif of a woman of vague upbringing. That
      so delicate a creature should have to face the miseries of a touring life&mdash;the
      comfortless lodgings, the ill-cooked food, the damp death-traps of
      dressing-rooms, the long circuitous Sunday train-journeys&mdash;roused him
      to furious indignation. He married her right away, took her incontinently
      from things theatrical, and found congenial occupation in adoring her. But
      the hapless lady survived her marriage only long enough to see Jimmie safe
      into short frocks, and then fell sick and died. The impulsive sailor
      educated the boy in his own fashion for a dozen years or so, and then he,
      in his turn, died, leaving his son a small inheritance to be administered
      by his only brother, an easy-going bachelor in a Government office. This
      inheritance sufficed to send Jimmie to Harrow, where he began his
      life-long friendship with Morland King, and to the École des Beaux-Arts in
      Paris, where he learned many useful things beside the method of painting
      pictures. When he returned to London, his uncle handed him over the
      hundred or two that remained, and, his duty being accomplished, fell over
      a precipice in the Alps, and concerned himself no more about his nephew.
      Then Jimmie set to work to earn his living.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he snatched the child Aline from the embraces of her tipsy aunt and
      carried her out into the street, wondering what in the world he should do
      with her, he was just under thirty years of age. How he had earned a
      livelihood till then and kept himself free from debt he scarcely knew.
      When he obtained a fair price for a picture, he deposited a lump sum with
      his landlord in respect of rent in advance, another sum with the keeper of
      the little restaurant where he ate his meals, and frittered the rest away
      among his necessitous friends. In the long intervals between sales, he
      either went about penniless or provided himself with pocket money by black
      and white or other odd work that comes in the young artist's way. His
      residence at that time consisted in a studio and a bedroom in Camden Town.
      His wants were few, his hopes were many. He loved his art, he loved the
      world. His optimistic temperament brought him smiles from all those with
      whom he came in contact&mdash;even from dealers, when he wasted their time
      in expounding to them the commercial value of an unmarketable picture. He
      was quite happy, quite irresponsible. When soberer friends reproached him
      for his hand-to-mouth way of living, he argued that if he scraped to-day
      he would probably spread the butter thick tomorrow, thus securing the
      average, the golden mean, which was the ideal of their respectability. As
      for success, that elusive will-o'-the-wisp, the man who did not enjoy the
      humour of failure never deserved to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he had rescued Aline from the limbo over the small apothecary's
      shop, as thoughtlessly and as gallantly as his father before him had
      rescued the delicate lady from the trials of theatrical vagabondage, he
      found himself face to face with a perplexing problem. That first night he
      had risen from an amorphous bed he had arranged for himself on the studio
      floor, and entered his own bedroom on tiptoe, and looked with pathetic
      helplessness on the tiny child asleep beneath his bedclothes. If it had
      been a boy, he would have had no particular puzzle. A boy could have been
      stowed in a corner of the studio, where he could have learned manners and
      the fear of God and the way of smiling at adversity. He would have
      profited enormously, as Jimmie felt assured, by his education. But with a
      girl it was vastly different. An endless vista of shadowy, dreamy,
      delicate possibilities perplexed him. He conceived women as beings
      ethereal, with a range of exquisite emotions denied to masculine
      coarseness. Even the Rue Bonaparte had not destroyed his illusion, and he
      still attributed to the fair Maenads of the Bal des Quatre-z' Arts the
      lingering fragrance of the original Psyche. Of course Jimmie was a fool,
      as ten years afterwards Norma had decided; but this view of himself not
      occurring to him, he had to manage according to his lights. Here was this
      mysterious embryo goddess entirely dependent on him. No corner of the
      studio and rough-and-tumble discipline for her. She must sleep on down and
      be covered with silk; the airs of heaven must not visit her cheek too
      roughly; the clatter of the brazen world must not be allowed to deafen her
      to her own sweet inner harmonies. Jimmie was sorely perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His charwoman next morning could throw no light on the riddle. She had
      seven children of her own, four of them girls, and they had to get along
      the best way they could. She was of opinion that if let alone and just
      physicked when she had any complaint, Aline would grow up of her own
      accord. Jimmie said that this possibility had not struck him, but
      doubtless the lady was right. Could she tell him how many times a day a
      little girl ought to be fed and what she was to eat? The charwoman's draft
      upon her own family experiences enlightened Jimmie so far that he put a
      sovereign into her hand to provide a dinner for her children. After that
      he consulted her no more. It was an expensive process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile it was obvious that a studio and one bedroom would not be
      sufficient accommodation, and Jimmie, greatly daring, took a house. He
      also engaged a resident housekeeper for himself and a respectable cat for
      Aline, and when he had settled down, after having spent every penny he
      could scrape together on furniture, began to wonder how he could pay the
      rent. A month or two before he would have as soon thought of buying a
      palace in Park Lane as renting a house in St. John's Wood&mdash;a cheap,
      shabby little house, it is true; but still a house, with drawing-room,
      dining-room, bedrooms, and a studio built over the space where once the
      garden tried to smile. He wandered through it with a wonderment quite as
      childish as that of Aline, who had helped him to buy the furniture. But
      how was he ever going to pay the rent?
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time he ceased asking the question. The ravens that fed Elijah
      provided him with the twenty quarterly pieces of gold. Picture-dealers of
      every hue and grade supplied him with the wherewithal to live. In those
      early days he penetrated most of the murky byways of his art&mdash;alleys
      he would have passed by with pinched nose a year before, when an empty
      pocket and an empty stomach concerned himself alone. Now, when the money
      for the last picture had gone, and no more was forthcoming by way of
      advance on royalties on plates, and the black and white market was
      congested, he did amazing things. He copied old Masters for a red-faced,
      beery print-seller in Frith Street, who found some mysterious market for
      them. The price can be gauged by the fact that years afterwards Jimmie
      recognised one of his own copies in an auction room, and heard it knocked
      down as a genuine Velasquez for eleven shillings and sixpence. He also
      painted oil landscapes for a dealer who did an immense trade in this line,
      selling them to drapers and fancy-warehousemen, who in their turn retailed
      them to an art-loving public, framed in gold, at one and eleven pence
      three farthings; and the artist's rate of payment was five shillings a
      dozen&mdash;panels supplied, but not the paint. To see Jimmie attack these
      was the child Aline's delight. In after years she wept in a foolish way
      over the memory. He would do half a dozen at a time: first dash in the
      foregrounds, either meadows or stretches of shore, then wash in bold,
      stormy skies, then a bit of water, smooth or rugged according as it was
      meant to represent pool or sea; then a few vigorous strokes would put in a
      ship and a lighthouse on one panel, a tree and a cow on a second, a woman
      and a cottage on a third. And all the time, as he worked at lightning
      speed, he would laugh and joke with the child, who sat fascinated by the
      magic with which each mysterious mass of daubs and smudges grew into a
      living picture under his hand. When his invention was at a loss, he would
      call upon her to suggest accessories; and if she cried out &ldquo;windmill,&rdquo;
       suddenly there would spring from under the darting brush-point a mill with
      flapping sails against the sky. Now and again in his hurry Jimmie would
      make a mistake, and Aline would shriek with delight:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jimmie, that's a cow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And sure enough, horned and uddered, and with casual tail, a cow was
      wandering over the ocean, mildly speculating on the lighthouse. Then
      Jimmie would roar with laughter, and he would tether the cow to a buoy and
      put in a milkmaid in a boat coming to milk the cow, and at Aline's
      breathless suggestion, a robber with a bow and arrow shooting the
      unnatural animal from the lighthouse top. Thus he would waste an hour
      elaborating the absurdity, finishing it off beautifully so that it should
      be worthy of a place on Aline's bedroom wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The months and years passed, and Jimmie found himself, if not on the
      highroad to fortune, at least relieved of the necessity of frequenting the
      murky byways aforesaid. He even acquired a little reputation as a portrait
      painter, much to his conscientious, but comical despair. &ldquo;I am taking
      people's money under false pretences,&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;I am an imaginative
      painter. I can't do portraits. Your real portrait painter can jerk the
      very soul out of a man and splash it on to his face. I can't. Why do they
      come to me to be photographed, when Brown, Jones, or Robinson would give
      them a portrait? Why can't they buy my subject-pictures which are good? In
      taking their money I am a mercenary, unscrupulous villain!&rdquo; Indeed, if
      Aline had not been there to keep him within the bounds of sanity, his
      Quixotism might have led him to send his clients to Brown or Jones, where
      they could get better value for their money. But Aline was there, rising
      gradually from the little child into girlhood, and growing in grace day by
      day. After all, the charwoman seemed to be right. The tender plant, left
      to itself, thrived, shot up apparently of its own accord, much to Jimmie's
      mystification. It never occurred to him that he was the all in all of her
      training&mdash;her mother, father, nurse, teacher, counsellor, example.
      Everything she was susceptible of being taught by a human being, he taught
      her&mdash;from the common rudiments when she was a little child to the
      deeper things of literature and history when she was a ripening maiden.
      Her life was bound up with his. Her mind took the prevailing colour of his
      mind as inevitably as the grasshopper takes the green of grass or the
      locust the grey-brown of the sand. But Jimmie in his simple way regarded
      the girl's sweet development as a miracle of spontaneous growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Aline on her part instinctively appreciated the child in Jimmie, and
      from very early years assumed a quaint attitude of protection in common
      every-day matters. From the age of twelve she knew the exact state of his
      financial affairs, and gravely deliberated with him over items of special
      expenditure; and when she was fourteen she profited by a change in
      housekeepers to take upon herself the charge of the household. Her
      unlimited knowledge of domestic science was another thing that astounded
      Jimmie, who to the end of his days would have cheerfully given two
      shillings a pound for potatoes. And thus, while adoring Jimmie and
      conscious that she owed him the quickening of the soul within her, she
      became undisputed mistress of her small material domain, and regarded him
      as a kind of godlike baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last there came a memorable day. According to a custom five or six
      years old, Jimmie and Aline were to spend New Year's Eve with some
      friends, the Frewen-Smiths.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a rising architect who had lately won two or three important
      competitions and had gradually been extending his scale of living. The New
      Year's Eve party was to be a much more elaborate affair than usual. Aline
      had received a beautifully printed card of invitation, with &ldquo;Dancing&rdquo; in
      the corner. She looked through her slender wardrobe. Not a frock could she
      find equal to such a festival. And as she gazed wistfully at the simple
      child's finery laid out upon her bed, a desire that had dawned vaguely
      some time before and had week by week broadened into craving, burst into
      the full blaze of a necessity. She sat down on her bed and puckered her
      young brows, considering the matter in all its aspects. Then, with her
      sex's guilelessness, she went down to the studio, where Jimmie was
      painting, and put her arms round his neck. Did he think she could get a
      new frock for Mrs. Frewen-Smith's party?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Jimmie in astonishment, &ldquo;what an idiotic question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want really a nice one,&rdquo; said Aline, coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then get one, dear,&rdquo; said Jimmie, swinging round on his stool, so as to
      look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'd like you to give me this one as a present. I don't want it to be
      like the others that I help myself to and you know nothing about&mdash;although
      they all are presents, if it comes to that&mdash;I want you to give me
      this one specially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie laid down palette and mahl-stick and brush, and from a letter-case
      in his pocket drew out three five-pound notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will this buy one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;Oh, you are silly, Jimmie,&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;A quarter of it will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took one of the notes, kissed him, and ran out of the studio, leaving
      Jimmie wondering why the female sex were so prone to weeping. The next day
      he saw a strange woman established at the dining-room table. He learned
      that it was a dressmaker. For the next week an air of mystery hung over
      the place. The girl, in her neat short frock and with her soft brown hair
      tied with a ribbon, went about her household duties as usual; but there
      was a subdued light in her eyes that Jimmie noticed, but could not
      understand. Occasionally he enquired about the new frock. It was
      progressing famously, said Aline. It was going to be a most beautiful
      frock. He would have seen nothing like it since he was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanity, thy name is little girls,&rdquo; he laughed, pinching her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 31st of December Jimmie, in his well-worn evening
      suit, came down to the dining-room, and for the first time in his life
      waited for Aline. He sat down by the fire with a book. The cab that had
      been ordered drew up outside. It was a remarkable thing for Aline to be
      late. After a while the door opened, and a voice said, &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
       Jimmie rose, turned round, and for a moment stared stupidly at the sight
      that met his eyes. It was Aline certainly, but a new Aline, quite a
      different Aline from the little girl he had known hitherto. Her brown hair
      was done up in a mysterious manner on the top of her head, and the tip of
      a silver-mounted tortoise-shell comb (a present, she afterwards confessed,
      from Constance Deering, who was in her secret) peeped coquettishly from
      the coils. The fashionably-cut white evening dress showed her neck and
      shoulders and pretty round arms, and displayed in a manner that was a
      revelation the delicate curves of her young figure. A little gold locket
      that Jimmie had given her rose and fell on her bosom. She met his stare in
      laughing, blushing defiance, and whisked round so as to present a side
      view of the costume. The astonishing thing had a train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; cried Jimmie. &ldquo;It never entered my head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you're a young woman, that you're grown up, that we'll have all the
      young men in the place falling in love with you, that you'll be getting
      married, and that I'm becoming a decrepit old fogey. Well, God bless my
      soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came up and put her hands on his shoulders and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it becoming, don't you, Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Becoming! Why, it's ravishing! It's irresistible! Do you mean to say that
      you got all that, gloves and shoes and everything, out of a five-pound
      note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Jimmie in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner came realisation of the fact that the tiny child he had
      undressed and put to sleep in his own bed ten years before had grown into
      a woman. The shock brought back some of the old perplexities, and created
      for a short while an odd shyness in his dealings with her. He treated her
      deferentially, regarded apologetically the mean viands on which he forced
      this fresh-winged goddess to dine, went out and wasted his money on
      adornments befitting her rank, and behaved with such pathetic foolishness
      that Aline, crying and laughing, threatened to run away and earn her
      living as a nursery-maid if he did not amend his conduct. Whereupon there
      was a very touching scene, and Jimmie's undertaking to revert to his
      previous brutality put their relations once more on a sound basis; but all
      the same there stole into Jimmie's environment a subtle grace which the
      sensitive in him was quick to perceive. Its fragrance revived the tender
      grace of a departed day, before he had taken Aline&mdash;a day that had
      ended in a woeful flight to Paris, where he had arrived just in time to
      follow through the streets a poor little funeral procession to a poor
      little grave-side in the cemetery of Bagneux. Her name was Sidonie
      Bourdain, and she was a good girl and had loved Jimmie with all her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tender grace was that of March violets. The essence of a maid's
      springtide diffused itself through the house, and springtide began to bud
      again in the man's breast. It was a strange hyperphysical transfusion of
      quickening sap. His jesting pictured himself as of a sudden grown hoary,
      the potential father of a full-blown woman, two or three years short of
      grandfatherdom. But these were words thrown off from the very lightness of
      a mood, and vanishing like bubbles in the air. Deep down worked the
      craving of the man still young for love and romance and the sweet message
      in a woman's eyes. It was a gentle madness&mdash;utterly unsuspected by
      its victim&mdash;but a madness such as the god first inflicts upon him
      whom he desires to drive to love's destruction. In the middle of it all,
      while Aline and himself were finding a tentative footing on the newly
      established basis of their relationship, the ironical deity took him by
      the hand and led him into the cold and queenly presence of Norma Hardacre.
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Jimmie fell back into his old ways with Aline, and the Great
      Frock Episode was closed.

    <h2>
      Chapter V&mdash;A BROKEN BUTTERFLY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LINE sat in the
      studio, the picture of housewifely concern, mending Jimmie's socks. It was
      not the unoffending garments that brought the expression into her face,
      but her glance at the old Dutch clock&mdash;so old and crotchety that
      unless it were tilted to one side it would not consent to go&mdash;whose
      hands had come with an asthmatic whir to the hour of eleven. And Jimmie
      had not yet come down to breakfast. She had called him an hour ago. His
      cheery response had been her sanction for putting the meal into
      preparation, and now the bacon would be uneatable. She sighed. Taking care
      of Jimmie was no light responsibility. Not that he would complain; far
      from it. He would eat the bacon raw or calcined if she set it before him.
      But that would not be for his good, and hence the responsibility. In
      slipping from her grasp and doing the things he ought not to do, he was an
      eel or a twelve-year-old schoolboy. Last night, for instance, instead of
      finishing off some urgent work for an art periodical, he had assured her
      in his superlative manner that it was of no consequence, and had wasted
      his evening with her at the Earl's Court Exhibition. It had been warm and
      lovely, and the band and the bright crowd had set her young pulses
      throbbing, and they had sat at a little table, and Jimmie had given her
      some celestial liquid which she had sucked through a straw, and
      altogether, to use her own unsophisticated dialect, it had been perfectly
      heavenly. But it was wrong of Jimmie to have sacrificed himself for her
      pleasure, and to have deceived her into accepting it. For at three or four
      o'clock she had heard him tiptoeing softly past her door on his way to
      bed, and the finished work she had found on his table this morning
      betrayed his occupation. Even the consolation of scolding him for
      oversleep and a spoiled breakfast was thus denied. She spread out her hand
      in the sock so as to gauge the extent of a hole, and, contemplating it,
      sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The studio was a vast room distempered in bluish grey, and Aline, sitting
      solitary at the far end, in the line of a broad quivering beam of light
      that streamed through a lofty window running the whole width of the
      north-east side, looked like a little brown saint in a bare conventual
      hall. For an ascetic simplicity was the studio's key-note. No curtains,
      draperies, screens, Japaneseries, no artistic scheme of decoration, no
      rare toys of furniture filled the place with luxurious inspiration. Here
      and there about the walls hung a sketch by a brother artist; of his own
      unsold pictures and studies some were hung, others stacked together on the
      floor. An old, rusty, leather drawing-room suite distributed about the
      studio afforded sitting accommodation. There was the big easel bearing the
      subject-picture on which he now was at work, with a smaller easel carrying
      the study by its side. On the model-stand a draped lay figure sprawled
      grotesquely. A long deal table was the untidy home of piles of papers,
      books, colours, brushes, artistic properties. A smaller table at the end
      where Aline sat was laid for breakfast. It was one of Jimmie's
      eccentricities to breakfast in the studio. The dining-room for dinner&mdash;he
      yielded to the convention; for lunch, perhaps; for breakfast, no. All his
      intimate life had been passed in the studio; the prim little drawing-room
      he scarcely entered half-a-dozen times in the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aline was contemplating the hole in the sock when the door opened. She
      sprang to her feet, advanced a step, and then halted with a little
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Are you disappointed?&rdquo; asked the smiling youth who had appeared
      instead of the expected Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can get over it. How are you, Tony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Anthony Merewether gave her the superfluous assurance that he was in
      good health. He had the pleasant boyish face and clean-limbed figure of
      the young Englishman upon whom cares sit lightly. Aline resumed her work
      demurely. The young man seated himself near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom are you calling 'Jimmie'?&rdquo; asked Aline. &ldquo;Mr. Padgate, if you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call him Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've called him so ever since I could speak. I think it was one of the
      first three words I learned. When you can say the same, you can call him
      Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how is Mr. Padgate?&rdquo; the snubbed youth asked with due humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can never tell how a man is before breakfast. Why are n't you at
      work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to her sagacity, and in answer to her question explained the
      purport of his visit. He was going to spend the day sketching up the
      river. Would she put on her hat and come with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine lot of sketching you'd do, if I did,&rdquo; said Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man vowed with fervour that as soon as he had settled down to a
      view he would work furiously and would not exchange a remark with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which would be very amusing for me,&rdquo; retorted Aline. &ldquo;No, I can't come.
      I'm far too busy. I've got to hunt up a model for the new picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tony leant back in his chair, dispirited, and began to protest. She
      laughed at his woeful face, and half yielding, questioned him about
      trains. He overwhelmed her with a rush of figures, then paused to give her
      time to recover. His eyes wandered to the breakfast-table, where lay
      Jimmie's unopened correspondence. One letter lay apart from the others.
      Tony took it up idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a letter come to the wrong house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is quite right,&rdquo; said Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is David Rendell, Esquire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rendell is a friend of Jimmie's, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard of him. What's he like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Jimmie never speaks of him,&rdquo; replied Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's odd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man threw the letter on the table and returned to the subject of
      the outing. She must accompany him. He felt a perfect watercolour working
      itself up within him. One of those dreamy bits of backwater. He had a
      title for it already, &ldquo;The Heart of Summer.&rdquo; The difference her presence
      in the punt would make to the picture would be that between life and
      deadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl fluttered a shy, pleased glance at him. But she loved to tease;
      besides, had she not but lately awakened to the sweet novelty of her young
      womanhood?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Jimmie won't let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tony sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Jimmie won't let you go!&rdquo; he exclaimed in
      indignant echo. &ldquo;Did he ever deny you a pleasure since you were born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes sparkled at his tribute to the adored one's excellences. &ldquo;That's
      just where it is, you see, Tony. His very goodness to me won't let me do
      things sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant hurried in with the breakfast-tray and the news that the
      master was coming down. Aline anxiously inspected the bacon. To her relief
      it was freshly cooked. In a minute or two a voice humming an air was heard
      outside, and Jimmie entered, smilingly content with existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Tony, what are you doing here, wasting the morning light? Have
      some breakfast? Why haven't you laid a place for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tony declined the invitation, and explained his presence. Jimmie rubbed
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day on the river! The very thing for Aline. It will do her good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't say I was going, Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going? Rubbish. Put on your things and be off at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I until I have given you your breakfast? And then there's the
      model&mdash;you would never be able to engage her by yourself. And you
      must have her to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I'm helpless, dear, but I can engage a model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And waste your time. Besides, you won't be able to find the address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are cab-horses, dear, with unerring instinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your breakfast is getting cold, Jimmie,&rdquo; said Aline, not condescending to
      notice the outrage of her economic principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually Jimmie had his way. Tony Merewether was summarily dismissed,
      but bidden to return in an hour's time, when Aline would be graciously
      pleased to be ready. She poured out Jimmie's coffee, and sat at the side
      of the table, watching him eat. He turned to his letters, picked up the
      one addressed to &ldquo;David Rendell.&rdquo; Aline noticed a shade of displeasure
      cross his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Mr. Rendell, Jimmie?&rdquo; asked Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man I know, dear,&rdquo; he replied, putting the envelope in his pocket. He
      went on with his breakfast meditatively for a few moments, then opened his
      other letters. He threw a couple of bills across the table. His face had
      regained its serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that these ill-mannered people are paid, Aline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What with, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money, my child, money. What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, noting a familiar expression
      on her face. &ldquo;Are we running short? Send them telegrams to say we'll pay
      next week. Something is bound to come in by then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Bullingdon ought to send the cheque for her portrait,&rdquo; said Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she will. And there's something due from Hyam. What a thing it
      is to have great expectations! Here's one from Renshaw,&rdquo; he said, opening
      another letter. &ldquo;'Dear Padgate'&mdash;Dear Padgate!&rdquo; He put his hands on
      the table and looked across at Aline. &ldquo;Now, what on earth can I have done
      to offend him? I've been 'Dear Jimmie' for the last twelve years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline shook her young head pityingly. &ldquo;Don't you know yet that it is
      always 'Dear Padgate' when they want to borrow money of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie glanced at the letter and then across the table again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Your knowledge of the world at your
      tender age is surprising. He does want money. Poor old chap! It is really
      quite touching. 'For the love of God lend me four pounds ten to carry me
      on to the end of the quarter.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's two months off. Mr. Renshaw will have to be more economical than
      usual,&rdquo; said Aline, drily. &ldquo;I am afraid he drinks dreadfully, Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, dear!&rdquo; he said, becoming grave. &ldquo;A man's infirmities are his
      infirmities, and we are not called upon to be his judges. How much have we
      in the house altogether?&rdquo; he asked with a sudden return to his bright
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten pounds three and sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's a fortune. Of course we can help Renshaw. Wire him his four
      pounds ten when you go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Jimmie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; expostulated this royal person's minister of
      finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what I say, my dear,&rdquo; said Jimmie, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That note in his voice always brought about instant submission, fetched
      her down from heights of pitying protection to the prostrate humility of a
      little girl saying &ldquo;Yes, Jimmie,&rdquo; as to a directing providence. She did
      not know from which of the two positions, the height or the depth, she
      loved him the more. As a matter of fact, the two ranges of emotion were
      perfect complements one of the other, the sex in her finding satisfaction
      of its two imperious cravings, to shelter and to worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Renshaw incident was closed, locked up as it were in her heart by the
      little snap of the &ldquo;Yes, Jimmie.&rdquo; One or two other letters were discussed
      gaily. The last to be opened was a note from Mrs. Deering. &ldquo;Come to lunch
      on Sunday and bring Aline. I am asking your friend Norma Hardacre.&rdquo; Aline
      clapped her hands. She had been longing to see that beautiful Miss
      Hardacre again. Of course Jimmie would go? He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another unconscious sitting for the portrait,&rdquo; he said. His glance
      wandered to a strainer that stood with its face to the wall, at a further
      end of the room, and he became absent-minded. Lately he had been dreaming
      a boy's shadowy dreams, too sweet as yet for him to seek to give them form
      in his waking hours. A warm touch on his hand brought him back to diurnal
      things. It was the coffee-pot held by Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked you twice if you would have more coffee,&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I'm the happiest being in existence,&rdquo; he said irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aline poured out the coffee. &ldquo;You have n't got much to make you happy,
      poor dear!&rdquo; she remarked, when the operation was concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      His retort was checked by a violent peal at the front door-bell and a
      thundering knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Morland,&rdquo; cried Jimmie. &ldquo;He is like the day of doom&mdash;always
      heralds his approach by an earthquake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland it was, in riding tweeds, a whip in his hand. He pointed an
      upbraiding finger at the half-eaten breakfast. The sloth of these
      painters! Aline flew to the loved one's protection. Jimmie had not gone to
      bed till four. The poor dear had to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't get to bed till four, either,&rdquo; said Morland, with the healthy,
      sport-loving man's contempt for people who require sleep, &ldquo;but I was up at
      eight and was riding in the Park at nine. Then I thought I'd come up here.
      I've got some news for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline escaped. Morland's air of health and prosperity overpowered her. She
      did not dare whisper detraction of him to Jimmie, in whose eyes he was
      incomparable, but to Tony Merewether she had made known her wish that he
      did not look always so provokingly clean, so eternally satisfied with
      himself. All the colour of his mind had gone into his face, was her
      uncharitable epigram. Aline, it will be observed, saw no advantage in a
      tongue perpetually tipped with honey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your news?&rdquo; asked Jimmie, as soon as they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done it at last,&rdquo; said Morland.
 </p>
    <p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proposed. I'm engaged. I'm going to be married.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
Jimmie's honest face
      beamed pleasure. He wrung Morland's hand. The best news he had heard for a
      long time. When had he taken the plunge into the pool of happiness?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have come straight to tell me? It is like you. I am touched, it
      is good to know you carry me in your heart like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland laughed. &ldquo;My dear old Jimmie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad. I never suspected anything of the kind. Well, she's an
      amazingly lucky young woman whoever she is. When can I have a timid peep
      at the divinity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you like&mdash;why, don't you know who it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, no, man; how should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Norma Hardacre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norma Hardacre!&rdquo; The echo came from Jimmie as from a hollow cave, and was
      followed by a silence no less cavernous. The world was suddenly reduced to
      an empty shell, black, meaningless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morland, with a short laugh. He carefully selected, cut, and
      lit a cigar, then turned his back and examined the half-finished picture.
      He felt the Briton's shamefacedness in the novelty of the position of
      affianced lover. The echo that in Jimmie's ears had sounded so forlorn was
      to him a mere exclamation of surprise. His solicitude as to the cigar and
      his inspection of the picture saved him by lucky chance from seeing
      Jimmie's face, which wore the blank, piteous look of a child that has had
      its most cherished possession snatched out of its hand and thrown into the
      fire. Such episodes in life cannot be measured by time as it is reckoned
      in the physical universe. To Jimmie, standing amid the chaos of his
      dreams, indefinite hours seemed to have passed since he had spoken. For
      indefinite hours he seemed to grope towards reconstruction. He lived
      intensely in the soul's realm, where time is not, was swept through
      infinite phases of emotion; finally awoke to a consciousness of
      renunciation, full and generous. Perhaps a minute and a half had elapsed.
      He crossed swiftly to Morland and clapped him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman among all women I could have wished for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice quavered a little; but Morland, turning round, saw nothing in
      Jimmie's eyes but the honest gladness he had taken for granted he should
      find there. The earnest scrutiny he missed. He laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are not many in London to touch her,&rdquo; he said in his self-satisfied
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem more royalist than&mdash;well, than Morland King,&rdquo; said the
      happy lover, chuckling at his joke. &ldquo;I wish I had the artist's command of
      superlatives as you have, Jimmie. It would come in deuced handy sometimes.
      Now if, for instance, you wanted to describe the reddest thing that ever
      was, you would find some hyperbolic image for it, whereas I could only say
      it was damned red. See what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does n't matter what you say, but what you feel,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
      &ldquo;Perhaps we hyperbolic people fritter away emotions in the mere frenzy of
      expressing them. The mute man often has deeper feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not going to set up as an unerupted volcano,&rdquo; laughed Morland.
      &ldquo;I'm only the average man that has got the girl he has set his heart on&mdash;and
      of course I think her in many ways a paragon, otherwise I should n't have
      set my heart on her. There are plenty to pick from, God knows. And they
      let you know it too, by Jove. You're lucky enough to live out of what is
      called Society, so you can't realise how they shy themselves at you.
      Sometimes one has to be simply a brute and dump 'em down hard. That's what
      I liked about Norma Hardacre. She required no dumping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;There's one thing that pleases me
      immensely,&rdquo; Morland remarked, &ldquo;and that is the fancy she has taken for
      you. It's genuine. I've never heard her talk of any one else as she does
      of you. She is not given to gush, as you may have observed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a very deep pleasure to me to hear it,&rdquo; said Jimmie, looking bravely
      in the eyes of the happy man. &ldquo;My opinion of Miss Hardacre I have told you
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland waved his cigar as a sign of acceptance of the tribute to the
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are a good many men I shall
      have to drop more or less when I'm married. Norma would n't have 'em in
      the house. There are others that will have to be on probation. Now I
      shouldn't have liked you to be on probation&mdash;to run the risk of my
      wife not approving of you&mdash;caring to see you&mdash;you know what I
      mean. But you're different from anybody else, Jimmie. I'm not given to
      talking sentiment&mdash;but we've grown up together&mdash;and somehow, in
      spite of our being thrown in different worlds, you have got to be a part
      of my life. There!&rdquo; he concluded with a sigh of relief, putting on his hat
      and holding out his hand, &ldquo;I've said it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brightening of Jimmie's eyes gave token of a heart keenly touched.
      Deeply rooted indeed must be the affection that could have impelled
      Morland to so unusual a demonstration of feeling. His nature was as
      responsive as a harp set in the wind. His counterpart in woman would have
      felt the tears well into her eyes. A man is allowed but a breath, a
      moisture, that makes the eyes bright. Morland had said the final word of
      sentiment; equally, utterly true of himself. Morland was equally a part of
      his life. It were folly to discuss the reasons. Loyal friendships between
      men are often the divinest of paradoxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The touch upon Jimmie's heart was magnetic. It soothed pain. It set free a
      flood of generous emotion, even thanksgiving that he was thus allowed
      vicarious joy in infinite perfections. It was vouchsafed him to be happy
      in the happiness of two dear to him. This much he said to Morland, with
      what intensity of meaning the fortunate lover was a myriad leagues from
      suspecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see you safely mounted,&rdquo; said Jimmie, opening the studio door. Then
      suddenly like a cold wind a memory buffeted him. He shut the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot. I have a letter for you. It came this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland took the letter addressed to &ldquo;David Rendell&rdquo; which Jimmie drew
      from his pocket, and uttered an angry exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought this infernal business was over and done with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tore open the envelope, read the contents, then tilted his hat to the
      back of his head, and sitting down on one of the dilapidated
      straight-backed chairs of the leather suite, looked at Jimmie in great
      perplexity. In justice to the man it must be said that anger had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know what these letters mean that you have been taking in
      for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never permitted myself to speculate,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;You asked me
      to do you a very great service. It was a little one. You are not a man to
      do anything dishonourable. I concluded you had your reasons, which it
      would have been impertinent of me to inquire into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the usual thing,&rdquo; said Morland, with a self-incriminatory shrug. &ldquo;A
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A love affair was obvious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland spat out an exclamation of impatient disgust for himself and rose
      to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows how it began&mdash;she was poor and lonely&mdash;almost a
      lady&mdash;and she had beauty and manners and that sort of thing above her
      class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They always have,&rdquo; said Jimmie, with a pained expression. &ldquo;You need n't
      tell me the story. It's about the miserablest on God's earth, is n't it
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Upon my soul, I'm not a beast, Jimmie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unwonted rarefied air of sentiment that he had been breathing for the
      last twelve hours had, as it were, intoxicated him. Had the letter reached
      him the day before, he would have left the story connected with it in the
      cold-storage depository where men are wont to keep such things. No one
      would have dreamed of its existence. But now he felt an exaggerated
      remorse, a craving for confession, and yet he made the naked remorseful
      human's instinctive clutch at palliatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul, I'm not a beast, Jimmie. I swear I loved her at first. You
      know what it is. You yourself loved a little girl in Paris&mdash;you told
      me about it&mdash;did n't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie set his teeth, and said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some women have ways with them, you know. They turn you into one of those
      toy thermometers&mdash;you hold the bulb, and the spirit in it rises and
      bubbles. She got hold of me that way&mdash;I bubbled, I suppose&mdash;it
      was n't her fault, she was sweet and innocent. It was her nature. You
      artistic people call the damned thing a temperament, I believe. Anyhow I
      was in earnest at the beginning. Then&mdash;one always does&mdash;I found
      it was only a passing fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And like a passing cab it has splashed you with mud. How does the matter
      stand now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read this,&rdquo; said Morland, handing him the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;the time is coming when you can be very good to me.
      Jenny.&rdquo; That was all. Jimmie, holding the paper in front of him, looked up
      distressfully at Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The time is coming when you can be very good to me.' How confoundedly
      pathetic! Poor little girl! Oh, damn it, Morland, you are going to be good
      to her, are n't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do all I can. Of course I'll do all I can. I tell you I'm not a
      beast. Heaps of other men would n't care a hang about it. They would tell
      her to go to the devil. I'm not that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you're not,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland lit another cigar with the air of a man whose virtues deserve some
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter can only have one interpretation. Have you known of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never dreamed of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there any question of marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever. Difference of position and all the rest of it. She quite
      understood. In fact, it was like your Quartier Latin affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie winced. &ldquo;It was n't the Quartier Latin&mdash;and I was going to
      marry her&mdash;only she died before&mdash;oh, don't mind me, Morland.
      What's going to be done now?&rdquo; Morland shrugged his shoulders again, having
      palliated himself into a more normal condition. His conscience, to speak
      by the book, was clothed and in its right mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's infernally hard lines it should come just at this time. You see,
      I've heaps of things to think about. My position&mdash;Parliament&mdash;I'm
      going to contest Cosford in the autumn. If the constituency gets hold of
      any scandal, I'm ruined. You know the Alpine heights of morality of a
      British constituency&mdash;and there's always some moral scavenger about.
      And then there's Norma&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there's Norma,&rdquo; said Jimmie, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's unpleasant, you see. If she should know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would break her heart,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland started and looked at Jimmie stupidly, his mental faculties for
      the second paralysed, incapable of grappling with the idea. Was it
      scathing sarcasm or sheer idiocy? Recovering his wits, he realised that
      Jimmie was whole-heartedly, childishly sincere. With an effort he
      controlled a rebellious risible muscle at the corner of his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would give her great pain,&rdquo; he said in grave acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a miserable business,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland paced the studio. Suddenly he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should there be any unpleasantness over this, can I rely on your help to
      pull me through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you can,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland looked relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I write a note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie pointed to a corner of the long deal table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find over there all the materials for mending a broken butterfly,&rdquo;
       he said sadly.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI&mdash;THE LOVERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ROUD in the
      make-believe that he was a fashionable groom, the loafer holding Morland's
      horse touched his ragged hat smartly at his temporary master's approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him something, Jimmie; I have n't any change,&rdquo; cried Morland. He
      mounted and rode away, debonair, with a wave of farewell. Jimmie drew from
      his pocket the first coin to hand, a florin, and gave it to the loafer,
      who came down forthwith from his dreams of high estate to commonplace
      earth, and after the manner of his class adjured the Deity to love the
      munificent gentleman. The two shillings would bring gladness into the
      hearts of his sick wife and starving children. Subject to the attestation
      of the Deity, he put forward as a truth the statement that they had not
      eaten food for a week. He himself was a hard-working man, but the
      profession of holding horses in the quiet roads of St. John's Wood was not
      lucrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're telling me lies, I'm afraid,&rdquo; said Jimmie, &ldquo;but you look miserable
      enough to say anything. Here!&rdquo; He gave him two more shillings. The loafer
      thanked him and made a bee-line for the nearest public-house, while
      Jimmie, forgetting for the moment the pitiable aspect that poor humanity
      sometimes wears in the persons of the lowly, watched Morland's well-set-up
      figure disappear at the turn of the road. There was no sign of black care
      sitting behind that rider. It perched instead on Jimmie's shoulders, and
      there stayed for the rest of the day. In spite of his staunch trust in
      Morland's honour and uprightness, he found it hard to condone the fault.
      The parallel which Morland had not too ingenuously drawn with the far-away
      passionate episode in his own life had not seemed just. He had winced,
      wondered at the failure in tact, rebelled against the desecration of a
      memory so exquisitely sad. The moment after he had forgiven the blundering
      friend and opened his heart again to pity. He was no strict moralist,
      turning his head sanctimoniously aside at the sight of unwedded lovers.
      His heart was too big and generous. But between the romance of illicit
      love and the commonplace of vulgar seduction stretched an immeasurable
      distance. The words of the pathetic note, however, lingering in his mind,
      brought with them a redeeming fragrance. They conjured up the picture of
      sweet womanhood. They hinted no reproach; merely a trust which was
      expected to be fulfilled. To her Morland was the honourable gentleman all
      knew; he had promised nothing that he had not performed, that he would not
      perform. All day long, as he sat before his easel, mechanically copying
      folds of drapery from the lay figure on the platform, Jimmie strove to
      exonerate his friend from the baser fault, and to raise the poor love
      affair to a plane touched by diviner rays. But the black care still sat
      upon his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he rose earlier than usual, and sought Morland at his
      house in Sussex Gardens. He found him eating an untroubled breakfast.
      Silver dishes, tray, and service were before him. A great flower-stand
      filled with Maréchal Niel roses stood in the centre of the table. Fine
      pictures hung round the walls. Rare china, old oak chairs, and sideboard
      bright with silver bowls&mdash;all the harmonious and soothing luxury of a
      rich man's dining-room, gave the impression of ease, of a life apart from
      petty cares, petty vices, petty ambitions. A thick carpet sheltered the
      ears from the creaking footsteps of indiscretion. Awnings before the open
      windows screened the too impertinent light of the morning sun. And the
      face and bearing of the owner of the room were in harmony with its
      atmosphere. Jimmie reproached himself for the doubts that had caused his
      visit. Morland laughed at them. Had he not twice or thrice declared
      himself not a beast? Surely Jimmie must trust his oldest friend to have
      conducted himself honourably. There was never question of marriage. There
      had been no seduction. Could n't he understand? They had parted amicably
      some three months ago, each a little disillusioned. Morland was generous
      enough to strip a man's vanity from himself and stand confessed as one of
      whom a superior woman had grown tired. The new development of the affair
      revealed yesterday had, he repeated, come upon him like an unexpected
      lash. The irony of it, too, in the first flush of his engagement!
      Naturally he was remorseful; naturally he would do all that a man of
      honour could under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More is not expected and not wanted. On my word of honour,&rdquo; said Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been upset, he continued smilingly. The consequences might be
      serious&mdash;to himself, not so much to Jenny. There were complications
      in the matter that might be tightened&mdash;not by Jenny&mdash;into a
      devil of a tangle. Had he not pleaded special urgency when he had first
      asked Jimmie to take in the letters under a false name? It might be a
      devil of a tangle, he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But till that happens&mdash;and please God it may never happen&mdash;we
      may dismiss the whole thing from our minds,&rdquo; said Morland, reassuringly.
      &ldquo;Jenny will want for nothing, and want nothing. Do you think if there were
      any melodramatic villainy on my conscience I would go and engage myself to
      marry Norma Hardacre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the final argument that sent the black care, desperately clinging
      with the points of its claws, into infinite space. Jimmie smiled again.
      Morland waved away the uncongenial topic and called for a small bottle of
      champagne on ice. A glass apiece, he said, to toast the engagement.
      Rightly, champagne was the wine of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the morning sunshine itself distilled,&rdquo; said Jimmie, lifting up his
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home on the top of an omnibus greatly cheered, convinced that,
      whatever had happened, Morland had done no grievous wrong. When Aline went
      to the studio to summon him to lunch, she found him busy upon the sketch
      portrait of Norma, and humming a tune&mdash;a habit of his when work was
      proceeding happily under his fingers. She looked over his shoulder
      critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very good,&rdquo; she condescended to remark. &ldquo;Now that Miss Hardacre is
      engaged to Mr. King, why don't you ask her to come and sit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it's a good likeness?&rdquo; he asked, leaning back and regarding
      the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the best likeness you have ever got in a portrait,&rdquo; replied Aline,
      truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, wisest of infants, what reason could I have for asking Miss
      Hardacre to sit? Besides, I don't want her to know anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline glowed with inspiration. Why should things the most distantly
      connected with somebody else's marriage so exhilarate the female heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it going to be a wedding present, Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a study in indiscretion, my child,&rdquo; he replied enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perfectly horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am,&rdquo; he admitted, looking at the portrait with some
      wistfulness. &ldquo;Ugly as sin, and with as much manners as a kangaroo =&mdash;does
      your feminine wisdom think a woman could ever fall in love with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She touched caressingly the top of his head where the hair was thinning,
      and her feminine wisdom made this astounding answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you are too old, Jimmie dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Too old! He turned and regarded her for a moment in rueful wonder. Absurd
      though it was, the statement gave him a shock. He was barely forty, and
      here was this full-grown, demure, smiling young woman telling him he was
      too old for any of her sex to trouble their heads about him. His forlorn
      aspect brought a rush of colour to the girl's cheeks. She put her arms
      round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jimmie, I have hurt you. I'm sorry. I'm a silly little goose. It's a
      wonder that every woman on earth is n't in love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the tone of exaggerated affection, but not of conviction,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I am the masculine of what in a woman is termed <i>passée</i>. I
      might gain the esteem of a person of the opposite sex elderly like myself,
      but my gallant exterior can no longer inspire a romantic passion. My day
      is over. No, you have not hurt me. The sword of truth pierces, but it does
      not hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he broke into his good, sunny laughter, and rose and put his arm with
      rough tenderness round her shoulder, as he had done ever since she could
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the youngest thing I have come across for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline, as she nestled up against him on their way out of the studio, was
      thus impressed with a salutary consciousness of her extreme youth. But
      this in itself magnified Jimmie's age. She loved him with a pure
      passionate tenderness; no one, she thought, could know him without loving
      him; but her ideal of the hero of romance for whom fair ladies pined away
      in despairing secret was far different. She was too young as yet, too
      little versed in the signs by which the human heart can be read, to
      suspect what his playful question implied of sadness, hopelessness,
      renunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday they lunched with Connie Deering. Morland and Norma and old
      Colonel Pawley, an ancient acquaintance of every one, were the only other
      guests. It was almost a family party, cried Connie, gaily; and it had been
      an inspiration, seeing that the invitations had been sent out before the
      engagement had taken place. Jimmie and Aline, being the first arrivals,
      had their hostess to themselves for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They both think it bad form to show a sign of it, but they are awfully
      gone upon each other,&rdquo; Connie said. &ldquo;So you must n't judge Norma by what
      she says. All girls like to appear cynical nowadays. It's the fashion. But
      they fall in love in the same silly way, just as they used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear they are fond of one another,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;The deeper
      their love the happier I shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little lady looked at him for a second out of the corner of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an odd thing to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be a commonplace thing to feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the happiness of others there is always something that is pleasing. By
      giving him the lie like that you will make poor Rochefoucauld turn in his
      grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be kept revolving like Ixion,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;His maxims are
      the Beatitudes of Hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed off the too trenchant edge of his epigram, qualifying it in his
      kind way. After all, you must n't take your cynic too literally. No doubt
      a kindly heart beats in the ducal bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know your real opinion of the devil,&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
      Deering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity for so doing was lost for the moment. The lovers entered,
      having driven together from the Park. At the sight of Norma, Aline
      twitched Jimmie's arm with a little gasp of admiration and Jimmie's breath
      came faster. He had not seen her hitherto quite so coldly, radiantly
      beautiful. Perhaps it was the great white hat she wore, a mystery of
      millinery, chiffon and roses and feathers melting one with the other into
      an effect of broad simplicity, that formed an unsanctified but alluring
      halo to a queenly head. Perhaps it was the elaborately simple cream dress,
      open-worked at neck and arms, that moulded her ripe figure into especial
      stateliness. Perhaps, thought poor Jimmie, it was the proud loveliness
      into which love was wont to transfigure princesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received Connie's kiss and outpouring of welcome with her usual
      mocking smile. &ldquo;If you offer me congratulations, I shall go away, Connie.
      I have been smirking for the last hour and a half. We were so exhausted by
      playing the sentimental idiots that we did n't exchange a word on our way
      here; though I believe Morland likes it. We saw those dreadful
      Fry-Robertsons bearing down upon us. He actually dragged me up to meet
      them, as who should say 'Let us go up and get congratulated.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why I should hide my luck under a bushel,&rdquo; laughed Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for the compliment,&rdquo; said Norma. &ldquo;But if you won at Monte Carlo
      you would n't pin the banknotes all over your coat and strut about the
      street. By the way, Connie, we're late. Need we apologise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not the last. Colonel Pawley is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! that old man radiates boredom. How can you stand him, Connie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the sweetest thing on earth,&rdquo; said her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma laughed a little contemptuously and came forward to greet Aline and
      Jimmie. As she did so, her face softened. Jimmie, drawing her aside,
      offered his best wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The happiness of a man whom I have loved like a brother all my life can't
      be indifferent to me. On that account you must forgive my speaking warmly.
      May you be very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be happy in having such a champion of my husband for a
      brother-in-law,&rdquo; said Norma, lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A loyal friend of your own, if you will,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause. Norma ran the tip of her gloved finger down the
      leaf of a plant on a stand. They were by the window. A vibration in his
      voice vaguely troubled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you really mean by 'loyal'?&rdquo; she said at last, without looking at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The word has but one meaning. If I tried to explain further, I should
      only appear to be floundering in fatuity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are the kind that would stick to a woman through thick and
      thin, through good repute and ill repute. That's what you mean. Only you
      don't like to hint that I might at any time become disreputable. I may.
      All things are possible in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;Perhaps I was unconsciously pleading for myself.
      Say you are a queen in your palace. While humbly soliciting a position in
      your household, I somewhat grandiloquently submit my qualifications.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this about?&rdquo; asked Morland, coming up, having overheard the
      last sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleading for a modest position in Her Majesty's Household,&rdquo; said
      Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll fit him up with cap and bells,&rdquo; laughed Morland, &ldquo;and make him
      chief jester, and give him a bladder to whack us over the head with. He's
      fond of doing that when we misbehave ourselves. Then he can get us out of
      our scrapes, like the fellow in Dumas&mdash;what's his name&mdash;Chicot,
      was n't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pleased with his jest, he turned to acquaint Connie with Jimmie's new
      dignity. Both the jest and the laugh that greeted it jarred upon Norma.
      Jimmie said to her good-humouredly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might be Chicot, the loyal friend, without the cap and bells. I am a
      dull dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked out of the window and laughed somewhat bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are a great deal too good to have anything to do with any of
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pleases you to talk arrant nonsense,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luncheon was announced. At table Jimmie and Norma were neighbours. Aline
      sat between Morland, who was next to Norma, and old Colonel Pawley. As the
      latter at first talked to Mrs. Deering, Aline and Morland carried on a
      frigid conversation. They had never been friends. To Morland, naturally,
      she was merely a little girl of no account, who had often been annoyingly
      in the way when he wanted to converse with Jimmie; and Aline, with a
      little girl's keen intuition, had divined more of his real character than
      she was aware of, and disliked and distrusted him. Like a well-brought-up
      young lady she answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; politely to his remarks, but
      started no fresh topic. At last, to her relief, Colonel Pawley rescued her
      from embarrassed silence. To him she had extended her favour. He was a
      short fat man, with soft hands and a curious soft purring voice, and the
      air rather of a comfortable old lady than of a warrior who had retired on
      well-merited laurels. He occupied his plentiful leisure by painting on
      silk, which he made into fans for innumerable lady acquaintances. In his
      coat-tail pocket invariably reposed a dainty volume bound in crushed
      morocco&mdash;a copy of little poems of his own composition&mdash;and
      this, when he was in company with a sympathetic feminine soul, he would
      abstract with apoplectic wheezing and bashfully present. He also played
      little tunes on the harp. Aline, with the irreverence of youth, treated
      him as a kind of human toy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first word roused the girl's spontaneous gaiety. She bubbled over with
      banter. The mild old warrior chuckled with her, threw himself unreservedly
      into the childish play. Connie whispered to Jimmie:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to tie a bit of blue ribbon round his neck and turn him
      loose in a meadow. I am sure he would frisk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland exchanged casual remarks with Norma. She answered absently. The
      change in Aline from the unsmiling primness wherewith Morland's society
      had cloaked her to sunny merriment with Colonel Pawley was too marked to
      escape her attention. In spite of the ludicrousness of the comparison, she
      could not help perceiving that the old man who radiated boredom had a
      quality of charm unpossessed by Morland, and she felt absurdly
      disappointed with her lover. During the last few days she had made up her
      mind to like him. Sober forecast of a lifetime spent in the inevitable
      intimacy of marriage had forced her to several conclusions. One, that it
      was essential to daily comfort that a woman should find the personality of
      a husband pleasing rather than antipathetic. With more ingenuousness than
      the world would have put to her credit, she had set herself deliberately
      to attain this essential ideal. The natural consequence was a sharply
      critical attitude and a quickly developing sensitiveness, whereby, as in a
      balance of great nicety, the minor evidences of his character were
      continually being estimated. Thus, Morland's jest before luncheon had
      jarred upon her. His careless air of patronage had betrayed a lack of
      appreciation of something&mdash;the word &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; was not in her
      vocabulary, or she might have used it&mdash;of something, at all events,
      in his friend which differentiated him from the casual artist and which
      she herself had, not without discomfort, divined at their first meeting.
      The remark had appeared to her in bad taste. Still ruffled, she became all
      the more critical, and noted with displeasure his failure to have won a
      child's esteem. And yet she felt a touch of resentment against Jimmie for
      being the innocent cause of her discomposure. It gave rise to a little
      feline impulse to scratch him and see whether he were not mortal like
      every one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever exhibit at the Royal Academy?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't have me,&rdquo; said he.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;But you send in, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With heart-breaking regularity. They did have me once.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;But
      that was many years ago, when the Academy was young and foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard they are exceedingly conservative,&rdquo; said Norma, with the
      claws still unsheathed. &ldquo;Perhaps you work on too original lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she could draw from him no expression of vanity. He smiled. &ldquo;I suppose
      they don't think my pictures good enough,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie's work is far too good for that wretched Academy,&rdquo; said Connie
      Deering. &ldquo;The pictures there always give you a headache. Jimmie's never
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to kill the Academy,&rdquo; Aline broke in sharply, on the brink
      of tears. A little tragedy of murdered hopes lurked in her tone. Then,
      seeing that she had caused a startled silence, she reddened and looked at
      her plate. Jimmie laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is n't she bloodthirsty? All the seventy of them weltering in their gore!
      Only the other day she said she would like to slaughter the whole Chinese
      Empire, because they ate puppies and birds'-nests!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie chimed a frivolous remark in tune with Jimmie. Morland, as befitted
      a coming statesman, took up the parable of the march westwards of the
      yellow races. Colonel Pawley, who had been through the Taeping rebellion,
      was appealed to as an authority on the development of the Chinaman. He
      almost blushed, wriggled uncomfortably, and as soon as he could brought
      the conversation to the milder topic of Chinese teacups. Successful, he
      sighed with relief and told Aline the story of the willow pattern. The
      Royal Academy was forgotten. But Norma felt guilty and ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was she set more at ease with herself by a careless remark of
      Morland's as Connie's front door closed behind them an hour or so later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you rather rubbed it into poor old Jimmie about the Academy.
      The little girl looked as if she would like to fly at you. She is a
      spoiled little cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed she does n't seem to like you,&rdquo; answered Norma, sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drive as far as Grosvenor Place, where Norma proposed to pay a
      solitary call, was not as pleasant as he had anticipated. He parted from
      her somewhat resentful of an irritable mood, and walked back towards
      Sussex Gardens through the Park, reviling the capriciousness of woman.

      Chapter VII&mdash;A MAD PROPHET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> VIOLENT man,
      pallid and perspiring, with crazy dark eyes and a voice hoarse from the
      effort to make himself heard above the noise of a hymn-singing group a few
      yards to the right and of a brazen-throated atheist on the left, was
      delivering his soul of its message to mankind&mdash;a confused,
      disconnected, oft-delivered message, so inconsequent as to suggest that it
      had been worn into shreds and tatters of catch-phrases by process of
      over-delivery, yet uttered with the passion of one inspired with a new and
      amazing gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking to you, the working-men, the proletariat, the downtrodden
      slaves of the plutocracy, the creators in darkness of the wealth that the
      idlers enjoy in dazzling halls of brightness. I do not address the
      bourgeoisie rotting in sloth and apathy. They are the parasites of the
      rich. They sweat the workers in order to pander to the vices of the rich.
      They despise the poor and grovel before the rich. They shrink from
      touching the poor man's hand, but they offer their bodies slavishly to the
      kick of the rich man's foot. It is not in their hands, but in yours,
      brother toilers and brother sufferers, that lies the glorious work of the
      great social revolution whose sun just rising is tipping the mountain-tops
      with its radiant promise of an immortal day. It is against them and not
      with them that you have to struggle. In that day of Armageddon you will
      find all tailordom, all grocerdom, all apothecarydom, all attorneydom
      arrayed in serried ranks around the accursed standards of plutocracy, of
      aristocracy, of bureaucracy. Beware of them. Have naught to do with them
      on peril of your salvation. The great social revolution will come not from
      above, but from below, from the depths. <i>De profundis clamavi!</i>
      &ldquo;From the depths have I cried, O Lord!&rdquo;

</p>
<p>

He paused, wiped his forehead,
      cleared his throat, and went on in the same strain, indifferent to ribald
      interjections and the Sunday apathy of his casual audience. The mere size
      of the crowd he was addressing seemed to satisfy him. The number was above
      the average. A few working-men in the inner ring drank in the wild
      utterances with pathetic thirst. The majority listened, half amused, half
      attracted by the personality of the speaker. A great many were captivated
      by the sonority of the words, the unfaltering roll of the sentences, the
      vague associations and impressions called up by the successive images. It
      is astonishing what little account our sociological writers take of the
      elementary nature of the minds of the masses; how easily they are amused;
      how readily they are imposed upon; how little they are capable of
      analytical thought; at the same time, how intellectually vain they are,
      which is their undoing. The ineptitudes of the music hall which make the
      judicious grieve&mdash;the satirical presentment, for instance, of the
      modern fop, which does not contain one single salient characteristic of
      the type, which is the blatant convention of fifty years back&mdash;are
      greeted with roars of unintelligent laughter. Books are written, vulgar,
      fallacious, with a specious semblance of philosophical profundity, and
      sell by the hundred thousand. The masses read them without thought,
      without even common intelligence. It is too great an intellectual effort
      to grasp the ideas so disingenuously presented; but the readers can
      understand just enough to perceive vaguely that they are in touch with the
      deeper questions of philosophy, and through sheer vanity delude themselves
      into the belief that they are vastly superior people in being able to find
      pleasure in literature of such high quality. And the word Mesopotamia is
      still blessed in their ears. Nothing but considerations such as these can
      explain the popularity of some of the well-known Sunday orators in Hyde
      Park. The conductors of the various properly organised mission services
      belong naturally to a different category. It is the socialist, the
      revivalist, the atheist, the man whose blood and breath seem to have
      turned into inexhaustible verbiage, that present the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some such reflections forced themselves into the not uncharitable mind of
      Jimmie as he stood on the outer fringe of the pallid man's audience and
      listened wonderingly to the inspired nonsense. He had left a delighted
      Aline to be taken by Colonel Pawley to the Zoological Gardens, and had
      strolled down from Bryanston Square to the north side of the Park. To
      lounge pleasantly on a Sunday afternoon from group to group had always
      been a favourite Sunday pastime, and the pallid man was a familiar figure.
      Jimmie had often thought of painting him as the central character of some
      historical picture&mdash;an expectorated Jonah crying to Nineveh, or a
      Flagellant in the time of the plague, with foaming mouth and bleeding
      body, calling upon the stricken city to repent. His artist's vision could
      see the hairy, haggard, muscular anatomy beneath the man's rusty black
      garments. He could make a capital picture out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man paused only for a few seconds, and again took up his parable&mdash;the
      battle of the poor and the rich. The flow of words poured forth, platitude
      on platitude, in turbid flood, sound and fury signifying elusively,
      sometimes the collectivist doctrine, at others the mere <i>sans-culotte</i>
      hatred of the aristocrat. Jimmie, speculating on the impression made by
      the oratory on the minds of the audience, moved slightly apart from the
      crowd. His glance wandering away took in Morland on his way home, walking
      sedately on the path towards the Marble Arch. He ran across the few yards
      of intervening space and accosted his friend gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and have a lesson in public speaking, and at the same time hear the
      other side of the political question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! go and stand among that rabble?&rdquo; cried Morland, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to stand among worse, so you had better get used to it.
      Besides, the man is a delightful fellow, with a face like Habakkuk,
      capable of everything. To hear him one would think he were erupting
      red-hot lava, whereas really it is molten omelette. Come. Your purple and
      fine linen will be a red rag to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laughing, he dragged the protesting Morland within earshot of the speaker.
      Morland listened superciliously for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What possible amusement can you find in this drivel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so devilish pathetic,&rdquo; said Jimmie, &ldquo;so human&mdash;the infinite
      aspiration and the futile accomplishment. Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hymn next door had ceased, the atheist was hunting up a reference, and
      the words of the pallid man's peroration resounded startlingly in the
      temporary silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that day when the sovereign people's will is law, when the weakest and
      the strongest shall share alike in the plenteous bounty of Providence, no
      longer shall the poor be mangled beneath the Juggernaut car of wealth, no
      longer shall your daughters be bound to the rich man's chariot-wheels and
      whirled shrieking into an infamy worse than death, no longer shall the
      poor man's soul burn with hell fire at the rich man's desecration of the
      once pure woman that he loves, no more rottenness, foulness, stench,
      iniquity, but the earth shall rest in purity, securely folded in the angel
      wings of peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his arms in a gesture of dismissal, turned his back on the crowd,
      and sat down exhausted on the little wooden bench that had been his
      platform. The crowd gradually moved away, some laughing idly, others
      reflectively chewing the cud of their Barmecide meal. Morland pointed a
      gold-mounted cane at the late speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who and what is this particular brand of damned fool?&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
Jimmie checked
      with a glance a working-man who had issued from the inner ring and was
      passing by, and translated Morland's question into soberer English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him?&rdquo; replied the working-man. &ldquo;That's Daniel Stone, sir. Some people say
      he's cracked, but he always has something good to say and I like listening
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he do when he is n't talking?&rdquo; asked Jimmie. &ldquo;Snatches a nap
      and a mouthful of food, I should say, sir,&rdquo; said the man, with a laugh. He
      caught Jimmie's responsive smile, touched his cap, like the downtrodden
      slave that he was, and went on his way. Jimmie glanced round for Morland
      and saw him striding off rapidly. He ran after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the hurry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That damned man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which? The one I was talking to? You surely did n't object&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. The other&mdash;Daniel Stone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a dangerous lunatic. I have heard of him. Why the devil did you want
      me to make an exhibition of myself among this scum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie stared. Morland broke into a laugh and held out his hand. &ldquo;Never
      mind. The beast got on my nerves with his chariot wheels and his
      desecration of maidens and the rest of it. I must be off. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie watched him disappear through the gate and turned back towards the
      groups. The pallid man was still sitting on his bench; a few children hung
      round and scanned him idly. Presently he rose and tucked his bench under
      his arm, and walked slowly away from the scene of his oratory. His burning
      eyes fixed themselves on Jimmie as he passed by. Jimmie accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been greatly interested in your address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you with another of the enemies of mankind. You are a gentleman, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Jimmie, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have nothing to do with you,&rdquo; retorted the man, with an angry
      gesture. &ldquo;I hate you and all your class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what have we done to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have turned my blood into gall and my soul into consuming fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get out of the dust and sit down under a tree and talk it over. We
      may get to understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no wish to understand you,&rdquo; said the man, coldly. &ldquo;Good-day to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; said Jimmie, with a smile. &ldquo;I am sorry you will not let us be
      better acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the next group, who were listening to a disproof of God's
      existence. But the atheist was a commonplace thunderer in a bowler hat,
      whose utterances fell tame on Jimmie's ears after those of the
      haggard-eyed prophet. He wandered away from the crowd, striking diagonally
      across the Park, and when he found comparative shade and solitude, cast
      himself on the grass beneath a tree. The personality of Daniel Stone
      interested him. He began to speculate on his daily life, his history. Why
      should he have vowed undying hatred against his social superiors? He
      reminded Jimmie of a character in fiction, and after some groping the
      association was recalled. It was the monk in Dumas, the son of Miladi. He
      wove an idle romance about the man. Perhaps Stone was the disinherited of
      noble blood, thirsting for a senseless vengeance. Gradually the drowsiness
      of deep June fell upon him. He went fast asleep, and when he awoke half an
      hour afterwards and began to walk homewards, he thought no more of Daniel
      Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on following Sunday afternoons he frequently stood for a while to
      listen to the man. It was always the same tale&mdash;sound and fury,
      signifying nothing. On one occasion he caught Jimmie's eye, and denounced
      him vehemently as an enemy of society. After that, Jimmie, who was of a
      peaceful disposition, ceased attending his lectures. He sympathised with
      Morland.

      Chapter VIII&mdash;HER SERENE HIGHNESS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> PRETTY quarrel
      between a princess and a duchess gave rise to circumstances in which the
      destiny of Jimmie was determined, or in which, to speak with modern
      metaphor, the germ of his destiny found the necessary conditions for
      development. Had it not been for this quarrel, Jimmie would not have
      stayed at the Hardacres' house; and had he not been their guest, the events
      hereafter to be recorded would not have happened. Such concatenation is
      there in the scheme of human affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess of Wiltshire was a mighty personage in the Hardacres' part of
      the county. She made social laws and abrogated them. She gave and she took
      away the brevet of county rank. She made and unmade marriages. To fall
      under the ban of her displeasure was to be disgraced indeed. She held a
      double sway in that the duke, her husband, had delegated to her his
      authority in sublunary matters, he being a severe mathematician and a dry
      astronomer, who looked at the world out of dull eyes, and regarded it with
      indifference as a mass of indistinguishable atoms forming a nebula, a sort
      of Milky Way, concerning which philosophic minds had from time to time
      theorised. He lived icily remote from society; the duchess, on the
      contrary, was warmly interested in its doings. In the county she reigned
      absolute; but in London, recognising the fact that there were other
      duchesses scattered about Mayfair and Belgravia, she was high-minded
      enough to modify her claims to despotic government. She felt it, however,
      her duty to decree that her last reception should mark the end of the
      London season.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this reception the Hardacres were always invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In previous years they had mounted the great staircase of Wiltshire House,
      their names had been called out, the duchess had given them the tips of
      her fingers, and the duke, tall, white-haired, ascetic, had let them touch
      his hand with the air of a man absently watching ants crawl over him; they
      had passed on, mixed with the crowd, and seen their host and hostess no
      more. But this year, to Mrs. Hardacre's thrilling delight, the duchess
      gave her quite a friendly squeeze, smiled her entire approbation of Mrs.
      Hardacre's existence, and detained her for a moment in conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget to come and have a little talk with me later. I have n't
      seen you since dear Norma's engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To dear Norma she was equally urbane, called her a lucky girl, and
      presented her as a bride-elect to the duke, who murmured a vague formula
      of congratulation which he had remembered from early terrestrial days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you how proud I am of you, Norma!&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, with
      a lump in her throat, as they passed on. &ldquo;The dear duchess! I wonder if I
      am sufficiently grateful to Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma, although in her heart pleased by the manifestation of ducal favour,
      could not let the opportunity for a taunt pass by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can refer to it in your prayers, mother: 'O God, I thank Thee for
      shedding Her Grace upon me.' Won't that do, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hardacre, very red in the face, trailing half a pace
      behind his wife and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma repeated her form of Thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! Devilish good! Tell that in the club,&rdquo; he said in high
      good-humour. His wife's glance suddenly withered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't approve of blasphemy,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards whom, mother dear?&rdquo; asked Norma, suavely. &ldquo;The Almighty or the
      duchess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, with a snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardacre, seeing in the distance a man to whom he thought he could
      sell a horse, escaped from the domestic wrangle. Mother and daughter
      wandered through the crowd, greeted by friends, pausing here and there to
      exchange a few words, until they came to the door of the music-room,
      filled to overflowing, where an operatic singer held the assembly in
      well-bred silence. At the door the crush was ten deep. On the outskirts
      conversation hummed like an echo of the noise from the suite of rooms
      behind. There they were joined by Morland. Mrs. Hardacre told him of the
      duchess's graciousness. He grinned, taking the information with the air of
      a man to whom the favour of duchesses bestowed upon his betrothed is a
      tribute to his own excellence. He thought she would be pleased, he said.
      They must get the old girl to come to the wedding. Mrs. Hardacre was
      pained, but she granted young love indulgence for the profanity. If they
      only could, she assented, the success of the ceremony would be assured.
      Norma turned to Morland with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be married with a vengeance, if it's sanctified by the duchess.
      Do you think a parson is at all necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He joined in her mirth. She drew him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what's the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He accounted, loverwise, for his day.. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked in upon Jimmie Padgate this morning. I wanted him to go to
      Christie's and buy a picture or two for me&mdash;for us, I ought to say,&rdquo;
       he added, with a little bow. &ldquo;He knows more about 'em than I do. He's a
      happy beggar, you know,&rdquo; he exclaimed, after a short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His perfect conviction that everything is for the best in the best of all
      possible worlds. There he was sitting at lunch over the black scrag end of
      a boiled mutton bone and a rind of some astonishing-looking yellow cheese&mdash;absolutely
      happy. And he waved his hand towards it as if it had been a feast of
      Lucullus and asked me to share it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; asked Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had n't time,&rdquo; said Morland. &ldquo;I was fearfully busy to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma did not reply. She looked over the heads of the crowd in front of
      her towards the music-room whence came the full notes of the singer. Then
      she said to him with a little shiver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you are a rich man, Morland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. Otherwise I should not have got you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true enough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I pretend to scoff at all this, but I
      could n't live without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has its points,&rdquo; he assented, turning and regarding the brilliant
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma turned with him. She was glad it was her birthright and her
      marriage-right. The vast state ballroom, lit as with full daylight by rows
      of electric lamps cunningly hidden behind the cornices and the
      ground-glass panels of the ceiling, stately with its Corinthian pilasters
      and classic frieze, its walls adorned with priceless pictures, notably
      four full-length cavaliers of Vandyck, smiling down in their high-bred way
      upon this assembly of their descendants, its atmosphere glittering with
      jewels, radiant with colour, contained all the magnificence, all the
      aristocracy, all the ambitions, all the ideals that she had been trained
      to worship, to set before her as the lodestars of her life's destiny. Here
      and there from amid the indistinguishable mass of diamonds, the white
      flesh of women's shoulders, the black and white chequer and brilliant
      uniforms of men, flashed out the familiar features of some possessor of an
      historic name, some woman of world-famed beauty, some great personage
      whose name was on the lips of Europe. There, by the wall, lonely for the
      moment, stood the Chinese Ambassador, in loose maroon silk, and horse-tail
      plumed cap, his yellow, wizened face rendered more sardonic by the thin
      drooping grey moustache and thin grey imperial, looking through horn
      spectacles, expressionless, impassive, inhumanly indifferent, at one of
      the most splendid scenes a despised civilisation could set before him.
      There, in the centre of a group of envious and unembarrassed ladies, an
      Indian potentate blazed in diamonds and emeralds, and rolled his dusky
      eyes on charms which (most oddly to his Oriental conceptions) belonged to
      other men. Here a Turk's red fez, a Knight of the Garter's broad blue
      sash, an ambassador's sparkle of stars and orders; and there the sweet,
      fresh rosebud beauty of a girl caught for a moment and lost in the moving
      press. And there, at the end of the vast, living hall, a dimly seen
      haggard woman, with a diamond tiara on her grey hair, surrounded by a
      little court of the elect, sat Her Serene Highness, the Princess of
      Herren-Rothbeck, sister to a reigning monarch, and bosom friend, despite
      the pretty quarrel, of Her Grace the Duchess of Wiltshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song in the music-room coming to an end, the audience for the most
      part rose and pressed into the ballroom. The Hardacres and Morland were
      driven forward. There was a long period of desultory conversation with
      acquaintances. Morland, proud in the possession of Norma's beauty,
      remained dutifully attendant, and received congratulations with almost
      blushing gratification. Mrs. Hardacre, preoccupied by anticipation of her
      promised talk with the duchess, kept casting distracted glances at the
      door whereby the great lady would enter. The appearance from a group of
      neighbouring people of a pleasant young fellow with a fair moustache and
      very thin fair hair, who greeted her cordially, brought her back to the
      affairs of the moment. This was the Honourable Charlie Sandys, a distant
      relative of the duchess, and her Grand Vizier, Master of the Horse, Groom
      of the Chambers, and general right-hand man. He was two and twenty, and
      had all the amazing wisdom of that ingenuous age. Morland shook hands with
      him, but being tapped on the arm by the fan of a friendly dowager, left
      him to converse alone with Mrs. Hardacre and Norma. The youth indicated
      Morland's retiring figure by a jerk of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parliament&mdash;Cosford division.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;Must get in. Radical for her
      constituency would make duchess buy her coffin. The end of the world for
      her. She has a great idea of King. Going to take him up <i>con amore</i>.
      And when she does take anybody up&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wave of the hand signified the tremendous consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does n't merely uproot <i>him</i>,&rdquo; said Norma, whose mind now and
      then worked with disconcerting swiftness, &ldquo;but she takes up also the
      half-acre where he is planted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied the youth. &ldquo;Not only him, but his manservant and
      maidservant, his ox and his ass and everything that is his. Funny woman,
      you know&mdash;one of the best, of course, but quaint. Thinks the Member
      for Cosford is ordained by Providence to represent her in Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rattled on, highly pleased with himself. Norma cast a malicious glance
      at her mother, who perceptibly winced. They were shining in the duchess's
      eyes in a light borrowed from Morland. They were taken up with the ox and
      the ass and the remainder of Morland's live-stock. That was the reason,
      then, of the exceptional marks of favour bestowed on them by Her Grace.
      Mrs. Hardacre kept the muscles of her lips at the smile, but her steely
      eyes grew hard. Norma, on the contrary, was enjoying herself. Charlie
      Sandys was unconscious of the little comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see the princess here to-night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, by way
      of turning the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth made practically the same reply as he had made at least a dozen
      times to the same remark during the course of the evening. He was an
      injudicious Groom of the Chambers, being vain of the privileges attached
      to his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been an awful row, you know,&rdquo; he said confidentially, looking
      round to see that he was not overheard. &ldquo;They have scarcely made it up
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell us about it, Mr. Sandys,&rdquo; said Norma, smiling upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's rather a joke. Let us get out of the way and I'll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He piloted them through the crush into a corridor, and found them a vacant
      seat by some palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all about pictures,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;Princess wants to have her
      portrait painted in London. Why she should n't have it made in Germany I
      don't know. Anyhow she comes to duchess for advice. Duchess has taken up
      Foljambe, you know&mdash;chap that has painted about twenty miles of women
      full length&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We saw the dear duchess at his Private View,&rdquo; Mrs. Hardacre interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She runs him for all she's worth. Told the princess there was only
      one man possible for her portrait, and that was Foljambe. Princess&mdash;she's
      as hard as nails, you know&mdash;inquires his price, knocks him down half.
      He agrees. Everything is arranged. Princess to sit for the portrait when
      she stays with duchess at Chiltern Towers in September&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we are going to have the princess down with us?&rdquo; Mrs. Hardacre grew
      more alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Couldn't find time to sit now&mdash;going next week to
      Herren-Rothbeck&mdash;coming back in September. Well, it was all settled
      nicely&mdash;you know the duchess's way. On Friday, however, she takes the
      princess to see Foljambe's show&mdash;for the first time. Just like her.
      The princess looks round, drops her lorgnon, cries out, 'Lieber Gott in
      Himmel! The man baints as if he was bainting on de bavement!' and utterly
      refuses to have anything to do with him. I tell you there were ructions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He embraced a knee and leant back, laughing boyishly at the memory of the
      battle royal between the high-born dames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who is going to paint the portrait?&rdquo; asked Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I am supposed to find out,&rdquo; replied the youth. &ldquo;But I can't
      get a man to do it cheap enough. One can't go to a swell R. A. and ask him
      to paint a portrait of a princess for eighteen pence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I recommend a friend of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he do it?&rdquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so&mdash;if I asked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, who is he?&rdquo; asked the youth, pulling down his shirtcuff for the
      purpose of making memoranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. James Padgate, 10 Friary Grove, N. W. He is Mr. King's most intimate
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can paint all right, can't he?&rdquo; asked the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautifully,&rdquo; replied Norma. &ldquo;Friary, not Priory,&rdquo; she corrected,
      watching him make the note. She felt the uncommon satisfaction of having
      performed a virtuous act; one almost of penance for her cruelty to him on
      Sunday week, the memory of which had teased a not over-sensitive
      conscience. The scrag end of boiled mutton and the rind of cheese had also
      affected her, stirred her pity for the poor optimist, although in a
      revulsion of feeling she had shivered at his lot. She had closed her eyes
      for a second, and some impish wizardry of the brain had conjured up a
      picture of herself sitting down to such a meal, with Jimmie at the other
      side of the table. It was horrible. She had turned to fill her soul with
      the solid magnificence about her. The pity for Jimmie lingered, however,
      as a soothing sensation, and she welcomed the opportunity of playing Lady
      Bountiful. She glanced with some malice from the annotated cuff to her
      mother's face, expecting to see the glitter of disapproval in her eyes. To
      her astonishment, Mrs. Hardacre wore an expression of pleased
      abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie Sandys pocketed his gold pencil and retired. He was a young man
      with the weight of many affairs on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a capital idea of yours, Norma,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you think so,&rdquo; replied Norma, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. It was most happy. We'll do all we can to help Morland's friend. A
      most interesting man. And if the princess gives him the commission, we can
      ask him down to Heddon to stay with us while he is painting the picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma was puzzled. Hitherto her mother had turned up the nose of distaste
      against Mr. Padgate and all his works. Whence this sudden change? Not from
      sweet charitableness, that was certain. Hardly from desire to please
      Morland. Various solutions ran in her head. Did an overweening ambition
      prompt her mother to start forth a rival to the duchess, as a snapper up
      of unconsidered painters? Scarcely possible. Defiance of the duchess? That
      way madness could only lie; and she was renowned for the subtle caution of
      her social enterprises. The little problem of motive interested her
      keenly. At last the light flashed upon her, and she looked at Mrs.
      Hardacre almost with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wonderful brain you have, mother!&rdquo; she cried, half mockingly, half
      in earnest. &ldquo;Fancy your having schemed out all that in three minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enjoyment of this display of worldcraft was still in her eyes when she
      came across Morland a little later; but she only told him of her
      recommendation of Jimmie to paint the princess's portrait. He professed
      delight. How had she come to think of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must have caught the disease of altruism from Mr. Padgate,&rdquo; she
      said. Then following up an idle train of thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you often put work&mdash;portraits and things&mdash;in his
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say that I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You know hundreds of wealthy people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie is not a man to be patronised,&rdquo; said Morland, sententiously, &ldquo;and
      really, you know, I can't go about touting for commissions for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Norma; &ldquo;he is far too insignificant a person to
      trouble one's head about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland looked pained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to hear you talk in that way about Jimmie,&rdquo; he said
      reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little scornful curl appeared on her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo; was all she vouchsafed to say. Unreasonably irritated, she
      turned aside and caught a passing <i>attache</i> of the French Embassy.
      Morland, dismissed, sauntered off, and Norma went down to supper with the
      young Frenchman, who entertained her for half an hour with a technical
      description of his motor-car. And the trouble, he said, to keep it in
      order. It needed all the delicate cares of a baby. It was as variable as a
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Norma, stifling a yawn. &ldquo;<i>La donna e automobile</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the drive home in the hired brougham, whose obvious hiredom caused
      Norma such chafing of spirit, Mrs. Hardacre glowed with triumph, and while
      her husband dozed dejectedly opposite, she narrated her good fortunes. She
      had had her little chat with the duchess. They had spoken of Mr. Padgate,
      Charlie Sandys having run to show her his cuff immediately. The duchess
      looked favourably on the proposal. A friend of Mr. King's was a
      recommendation in itself. But the princess, she asseverated with ducal
      disregard of metaphor, had her own ideas of art and would not buy a pig in
      a poke. They must inspect Mr. Padgate's work before there was any question
      of commission. She would send Charlie Sandys to them to-morrow to talk
      over the necessary arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, &ldquo;that Mr. Padgate was coming to pay us a
      visit in any case in September, and suggested that he could drive over to
      Chiltern Towers every morning while the princess was honouring him with
      sittings, and paint the picture there. And she quite jumped at the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Norma, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her dryness had no withering effect on her mother's exuberance. The
      hard woman saw the goal of a life's ambition within easy reach, and for
      the exultant moment softened humanly. She chattered like a school-girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she took me up to the princess,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and presented me as her
      nearest country neighbour. Was n't that nice of her? And the princess is
      such a sweet woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; said Norma. &ldquo;How wicked people are! Every one says she is
      the most vinegarish old cat in Christendom.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter IX&mdash;SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>AME and fortune
      were coming at last. There was no doubt of it in Jimmie's optimistic mind.
      For years they had lagged with desperately heavy feet, but now they were
      in sight, slowly approaching, hand in hand. Jimmie made fantastic
      preparations to welcome them, and wore his most radiant smile. In vain did
      Aline, with her practical young woman's view of things, point to the
      exiguity of the price fixed by Her Serene Highness. If that was the advent
      of fortune, she came in very humble guise, the girl insinuated. Jimmie,
      with a magnificent sweep of the hand, dismissed such contemptible
      considerations as present pounds, shillings, and pence. He was going to
      paint the portrait of the sister of a reigning monarch. Did not Aline see
      that this might lead to his painting the portrait of the reigning monarch
      himself? Would not the counterfeit presentment of one crowned head attract
      the attention of other crowned heads to the successful artist? Did she not
      see him then appointed painter in ordinary to all the emperors, kings,
      queens, princes, and princesses of Europe? He would star the Continent,
      make a royal progress from court to court, disputed for by potentates and
      flattered by mighty sovereigns. He grew dithyrambic, a condition in which
      Aline regarded him as hopelessly impervious to reason. His portraits, he
      said, would adorn halls of state, and the dreams that he put on canvas,
      hitherto disregarded by a blind world, would find places of honour in the
      Treasure Houses of the Nations. It would be fame for him and fortune for
      Aline. She should go attired in silk and shod with gold. She should have a
      stall at the theatre whenever she wanted, and a carriage and pair to fetch
      her home. She should eat vanilla ices every night. And then she might
      marry a prince and live happy ever after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to marry a prince or any one else, dear,&rdquo; Aline said once,
      bringing visions down into the light of common day. &ldquo;I just want to go on
      staying with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion she hinted at his possible espousal of a princess.
      Again Jimmie dropped from the empyrean, and rubbed his head ruefully.
      There was only one princess in the world for him, an enthroned personage
      of radiant beauty who now and then took warm pity on him and admitted him
      to her friendship, but of whom it were disloyalty worse than all folly to
      think of. And yet he could not help his heart leaping at the sight of her,
      or the thrill quivering through him when he saw the rare softness come
      into her eyes which he and none other had evoked. What he had to give her
      he could give to no other woman, no other princess. The gift was
      unoffered: it remained in his own keeping, but consecrated to the
      divinity. He enshrined it, as many another poor chivalrous wretch has
      done, in an exquisite sanctuary, making it the symbol of a vague sweet
      religion whose secret observances brought consolation. But of all this,
      not a whisper, not a sign to Aline. When she spoke of marriageable
      princesses, he explained the rueful rubbing of his head by reference to
      his unattractive old fogeydom, and his unfitness for the life of high
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aline ought to have her prince. The coming fortune would help to give
      the girl what was due to her. For himself he cared nothing. Cold mutton
      and heel of cheese would satisfy him to the end of his days. And fame? In
      quieter moments he shrugged his shoulders. An artist has a message to
      deliver to his generation, and how can he deliver it if he cannot sell his
      pictures? Let him give out to the world what was best in him, and he
      would be content. Let him but be able to say, &ldquo;I have delivered my
      message,&rdquo; and that would be fame enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were things of the depths. The surface of his mood was exuberant,
      almost childish, delight, tempered with whimsical diffidence in his power
      of comporting himself correctly towards such high personages. For the
      duchess, who never did things by halves, and was also determined, as she
      had said, of not buying a pig in a poke, had conveyed to him the
      intimation that Her Serene Highness the Princess of Herren-Rothbeck would
      honour him with a visit to his studio on the following Thursday. Jimmie
      and Aline held long counsel together. What was the proper way to receive a
      Serene Highness? Jimmie had a vague idea of an awning outside the door and
      a strip of red baize down the steps and across the pavement. Tony
      Merewether, who was called into consultation, suggested, with the
      flippancy of youth, a brass band and a chorus of maidens to strew flowers;
      whereat Aline turned her back upon him, and Jimmie, adding pages in fancy
      dress to hold up the serene train and a major-domo in a court suit with a
      wand, encouraged the offender. Aline retired from so futile a discussion
      and went on sewing in dignified silence. At last she condescended to throw
      out a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, Jimmie, I should get the princess some portraits to look
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul,&rdquo; cried Jimmie, putting down his pipe, &ldquo;I never thought
      of it. Tony, my boy, that child with the innocence of the dove combines
      the wisdom of the original serpent. My brain reels to think what I should
      be without her. We'll telegraph to all the people that have sat to me and
      ask them to send in their portraits by Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the studio and began to rummage among the litter on the long
      table. Aline asked him what he was looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telegram forms. Why have n't we got any? Tony, run round the corner to
      the post-office, like a good boy, and get some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aline checked the execution of this maniacal project. Three portraits
      would be quite sufficient. Jimmie would have to pick out three ladies of
      whom he could best ask such a favour, and write them polite little notes
      and offer to send a van in the orthodox way to collect the pictures.
      Jimmie bowed before such sagacity, and wrote the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the week the portraits arrived, and the studio for a
      whole day became the undisputed kingdom of Aline and a charwoman. The long
      untidy table, so dear to Jimmie, was ruthlessly cleared and set in
      dismaying order. The frame-maker was summoned, and the unsold pictures
      that had long slumbered sadly on the ground with their faces to the wall,
      were dusted and hung in advantageous lights. The square of Persian carpet,
      which Jimmie during an unprotected walk through Regent Street had once
      bought for Aline's bedroom, was brought down and spread on the bare boards
      of the model-platform. A few cushions were scattered about the rusty
      drawing-room suite, and various odds and ends of artists' properties, bits
      of drapery, screens, old weapons, were brought to light and used for
      purposes of decoration. So that when Jimmie, who had been banished the
      house for the day, returned in the evening, he found a flushed and
      exhausted damsel awaiting him in a transfigured studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear little girl,&rdquo; he said, touched, &ldquo;my dear little girl, it's
      beautiful, it's magical. But you have tired yourself to death. Why did n't
      you let me do all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would never have done it yourself, Jimmie. You know you wouldn't,&rdquo;
       said Aline. &ldquo;You would have gone on talking nonsense about red baize
      strips and flower-girls and pages&mdash;anything to make those about you
      laugh and be happy&mdash;and you would never have thought of showing off
      what you have to its full advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have dreamed of robbing your poor little room of its
      carpet, dear,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went upstairs for their simple evening meal, and returned as usual to
      the beloved studio. Aline filled Jimmie's pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I dare smoke in all this magnificence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and struck a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not realise what a lot of beautiful pictures you had, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They make a brave show,&rdquo; he said, looking round. &ldquo;After all, I'm not
      entirely sorry they have never been sold. I should not like to part with
      them. No, I did not realise how many there were.&rdquo; In spite of his
      cheeriness the last words sounded a note of pathos that caught the girl's
      sensitive ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Let us make a tour of inspection,&rdquo; she said. They went the round,
      pausing long before each picture. He said little, contrary to his habit,
      for he was wont to descant on his work with playful magniloquence. He saw
      the years unfold behind him and disclose the hopes of long ago yet
      unfulfilled. What endless months of dreams and thrills and passionate toil
      hung profitless upon these walls! Things there were, wrought from the
      depths of his radiant faith in man, plucked from the heart of his
      suffering, consecrated by the purest visions of his soul. Had Aline been
      an older woman, a woman who had loved him, lived with him in a wife's
      intimate communion, instead of being merely the tender-hearted child of
      his adoption, she would have wept her heart out. For she, alone of
      mortals, would have got behind such imperfections as there were, and would
      have seen nothing but a crucifixion of the quivering things torn out of
      the life of the beloved man. Only vaguely, elusively did the girl feel
      this. But even her half-comprehending sympathy was of great comfort. She
      thought no one in the world could paint like Jimmie, and held in angry
      contempt a public that could pass him by. She was hotly his advocate,
      furious at his rejection by hanging committees, miserably disappointed
      when his pictures came back from exhibitions unsold, or when negotiations
      with dealers for rights of reproduction fell through. But she was too
      young to pierce to the heart of the tragedy; and Jimmie was too brave and
      laughter-loving to show his pain. Other forces, too, had been at work in
      her development. Recently her mind had been grappling with the problem of
      her unpayable debt to him. This silent pilgrimage round the years brought
      her thoughts instinctively to herself and the monstrous burden she had
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been wondering lately, Jimmie dear,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;whether
      you would not have been more successful if you had not had all the worry
      and expense and responsibility of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he cried in simple amazement, &ldquo;whatever are you talking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She repeated her apologia, though in less coherent terms. She felt
      foolish, as a girl does when a carefully prepared expression of feeling
      falls upon ears which, though inexpressibly dear, are nevertheless not
      quite comprehending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had to do pot-boilers,&rdquo; she said, falling into miserable bathos,
      &ldquo;and I remember the five-shillings-a-dozen landscapes&mdash;and you would
      have spent all that time on your real work&mdash;Oh, don't you see what I
      mean, Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him pathetically&mdash;she was a slight slip of a girl,
      and he was above the medium height. He smiled and took her fresh young
      face between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you're the only successful piece of work I've ever
      turned out in my life. Please allow me to have some artistic satisfaction&mdash;and
      you have been worth a gold-mine to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus each was comforted. Jimmie settled down to his pipe and a book, Aline
      sat over her sewing&mdash;the articles to which she devoted her perennial
      industry were a never solved mystery to him&mdash;and they spent a
      pleasant evening. The inevitable topic naturally arose in conversation.
      They discussed the princess's visit, the great question&mdash;how was she
      to be received?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing you can do,&rdquo; said the practical Aline, &ldquo;is to go to Mrs.
      Deering to-morrow and get properly coached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie looked at her in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are worth your weight in diamonds,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He carried out his project, and not only did he have the pleasure of
      finding Connie at home undisturbed by strange tea-drinking women, but
      Norma Hardacre came in soon after his arrival. The two ladies formed
      themselves into a committee of advice, and sent Jimmie home with most
      definite notions regarding the correct method of receiving Serene
      Highnesses. He also brought Aline the news that the committee would honour
      him with a visit the following morning, accompanied by Mrs. Hardacre, who
      had been pleased to express a desire to see his pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appointed hour came, and with it the ladies. Mrs. Hardacre's lips
      smiled sweetly at the man who was to be taken up by a duchess and to paint
      the portrait of a princess. She declared herself delighted with the studio
      and professed admiration for the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they all really your own, Mr. Padgate?&rdquo; she asked, turning towards
      him, her tortoise-shell lorgnon held sceptre-wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid so,&rdquo; answered Jimmie, with a smile. &ldquo;Sometimes I wish they
      were not so much my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should feel quite proud of them, if I were you,&rdquo; said the lady,
      desirous to please.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie broke into a laugh, and explained that Jimmie had implied a regret
      that they had found no purchasers. Mrs. Hardacre sniffed. She did not like
      being laughed at, especially as she had gone out of her way to be urbane.
      This was unfortunate for Jimmie; for though he strove hard to remove the
      impression that he had consciously dug a pit of ridicule for her
      entrapment, Mrs. Hardacre listened to his remarks with suspicion and
      became painfully aware of the shabbiness of his coat. Presently she
      regarded one of the portraits&mdash;that of a pretty, fluffy-haired woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she remarked somewhat frigidly, &ldquo;that is Mrs. Marmaduke
      Hewson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie, in the simplicity of his heart, was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A most charming lady. Do you know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I don't know her, but I know of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her stress on the preposition signified even deeper and more far-reaching
      things than the nod of Lord Burleigh in the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know of her?&rdquo; asked Jimmie, bluntly. Mrs. Hardacre smiled
      frostily, and her lean shoulders moved in an imperceptible shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those matters belong to the realm of unhappy gossip, Mr. Padgate; but I'm
      afraid the duchess won't find her portrait attractive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really rather a good portrait,&rdquo; said Jimmie, in puzzled modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the pity of it,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Hardacre, sweetly.
</p>
    <p>
The victim
      smiled. &ldquo;Surely the private character of the subject can have nothing to
      do with a person's judgment of a portrait as a specimen of the painter's
      art. And besides, Mrs. Hewson is as dear and sweet and true a little woman
      as I have ever met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not the first of your sex that has said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I most sincerely hope I shall not be the last,&rdquo; said Jimmie, with a
      little flush and a little flash in his eyes and the politest of little
      bows. Whereupon Mrs. Hardacre bit her lip and hated him. Norma, seizing
      the opportunity of contributing to the final rout of her mother,
      unwittingly did Jimmie some damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We women ought not to have given up fancy work,&rdquo; she said in her hardest
      and most artificial tones. &ldquo;As we don't embroider with our fingers, we
      embroider with our tongues. You can have no idea what an elaborate tissue
      of lies has been woven about that poor little Mrs. Hewson. I agree with
      Mr. Padgate. I am sorry you believe them, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie's grateful glance smote her undeserving heart. She had gained
      credit under false pretences and felt hypocritical&mdash;an unpleasant
      feeling, for the assumption of unpossessed virtues was not one of her
      faults. She succeeded, however, in rendering her mother furious. In a very
      short time Mrs. Hardacre remembered an engagement and went away in a
      hansom-cab, refusing the seat in Connie's carriage, which was put at her
      disposal on the condition of her waiting a few moments longer. She had
      thanked Jimmie, however, for the pleasure afforded by his delightful
      pictures with such politeness when he saw her into the cab, that he did
      not for a moment suspect that the lady who had entered the house with
      expressions of friendliness had driven away in a rage, with feelings
      towards him ludicrously hostile. He returned to the studio at peace with
      all womankind; not sorry that Mrs. Hardacre had departed, but only because
      courtesy no longer demanded his relegating to the second sphere of his
      attention the divine personage of whom he felt himself to be the slave. No
      suspicion of Mrs. Hardacre's spiteful motive in deprecating the display of
      his most striking piece of portraiture ever entered his head. He ran down
      the studio stairs with the eagerness of a boy released from the flattering
      but embarrassing society of his elders and free to enjoy the companionship
      of his congeners. And he was childishly eager to show his pictures to
      Norma, to hear her verdict, to secure her approval, so that he should
      stand in her eyes as a person in some humble way worthy of the regard that
      Morland said she bestowed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his visitors not looking at pictures at all, but talking to
      Aline, who rushed to him as soon as he entered the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jimmie&mdash;just fancy! Mrs. Deering is going to take me to
      Horlingham on Saturday, and is coming upstairs with me to see what I can
      do in the way of a frock. You don't mind, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie looked down into the happy young face and laughed a happy laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Deering is an angel from the most exclusive part of heaven,&rdquo; he
      said. And this was one of the rare occasions on which he was guilty of a
      double meaning. Had not the angel thus contrived an unlooked-for joy&mdash;a
      few minutes' undisturbed communion with his divinity?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first words that Norma spoke when they were alone were an apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not take what my mother said in ill part. She and I have been
      bred, I'm afraid, in a hard school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very kind of Mrs. Hardacre to warn me of the possibility of the
      duchess being prejudiced against me by the exhibition of a particular
      portrait. I can't conceive the possibility myself. But still Mrs.
      Hardacre's intention was kindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma turned her head away for a moment. She could not trust herself to
      speak, for a stinging sarcasm with just a touch of the hysterical would
      have been all she could utter, and she had not the heart to undeceive him.
      She shot into the by-path of the gossip concerning Mrs. Hewson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother believes the stories about her. So do I in the loose sort of way
      in which our faith in anything is composed&mdash;even in our
      fellow-creatures' failings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You defended her,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made me do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either you, because you carry about with you an uncomfortable Palace of
      Truth sort of atmosphere, or else the desire to rub it into my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rub what in?&rdquo; Jimmie was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma laughed somewhat bitterly. She saw that he was incapable of
      understanding the vulgar pettiness of the scheme of motives that had
      prompted the utterances of her mother and herself. She could not explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are born out of your century,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was lucky for Jimmie that he was unaware of the passionate tribute the
      light words implied. She gave him no time to answer, but carried him
      straight to the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea you did such beautiful work,&rdquo; she said, looking around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie followed her glance, and the melancholy of the artist laid its
      touch for a moment upon him. He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might have been beautiful if I had done what I started out to do. It
      is the eternal tragedy of the clipped wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was oddly responsive to a vibration in his voice, and gave out, like a
      passive violin, the harmonic of the struck note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better to have wings that are clipped than to have no wings at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never uttered such a sentiment, never thought such a thought in
      her life before. Her words sounded unreal in her own ears, and yet she had
      a profound sense of their sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no apteryx among human souls,&rdquo; said Jimmie, released from the
      melancholy fingers. They argued the point in a lighter vein, discussed
      individual pictures. Charmed by her sympathy, he spoke freely of his work,
      his motives, his past dreams. Had Norma not begun to know him, she might
      have wondered at the lack of bitterness in his talk. To this man of many
      struggles and many crushing disappointments the world was still young and
      sweet, and his faith in the ultimate righteousness of things undimmed. The
      simple courage of his attitude towards life moved her admiration. She felt
      somewhat humbled in the presence of a spirit stronger, clearer than any
      into which chance had hitherto afforded her a glimpse. And as he talked in
      his bright, half-earnest, half-humourous way, it crossed her mind that
      there was a fair world of thought and emotion in which she and her like
      had not set their feet; not the world entirely of poetic and artistic
      imaginings, but one where inner things mattered more than outer
      circumstance, where it would not be ridiculous or affected to think of the
      existence of a soul and its needs and their true fulfilment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto meeting him as an alien in her world, she had regarded him with a
      touch of patronising pity. From this she was now free. She saw him for the
      first time in harmony with his environment, as the artist sensitive and
      responsive, integral with the beautiful creations that hung around the
      walls, and still homely and simple, bearing the rubs of time as bravely
      and frankly as the old drawing-room suite that furnished the unpretentious
      studio. Now it was she who felt herself somewhat disconcertingly out of
      her element. The sensation, however, had a curious charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one picture that had attracted her from the first. She stood in
      front of it moved by its pity and tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about this one,&rdquo; she said without looking at him. She divined
      that it was very near his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the foreground amid laughing woodland crouched a faun with little furry
      ears and stumps of horns, and he was staring in piteous terror at a
      vision; and the vision was that of a shivering, outcast woman on a wet
      pavement in a sordid street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the joyous, elemental creature's first conception of pain,&rdquo; said
      Jimmie, after a few moments' silence. &ldquo;You see, life has been to him only
      the sunshine, and the earth drenched with colour and music&mdash;as the
      earth ought to be&mdash;and now he sees a world that is coming grey with
      rain and misty with tears, and he has the horror of it in his eyes. I am
      not given to such moralising in paint,&rdquo; he added with a smile. &ldquo;This is a
      very early picture.&rdquo; He looked at it for some time with eyes growing
      wistful. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I did it many years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has a history then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted; and he remembered how the outcast figure in the rain
      had symbolised that little funeral procession in Paris and how terribly
      grey the world had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma's chastened mood had not awed the spirit of mockery within her, but
      had rendered it less bitter, and had softened her voice. She waved her
      hand towards the crouching faun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie caught a kind raillery in her glance, and laughed. Yes, she had his
      secret; was the only person who had ever guessed him beneath the travesty
      of horns and goat's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you for laughing,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other painters have shown me their pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which signifies&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That this is one of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen,&rdquo; she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are you glad that I laughed?&rdquo; asked Jimmie, in happy puzzledom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you, Mr. Padgate, all that I am going to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the inscrutable,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in the old pagan joy of life?&rdquo; she asked after a pause. &ldquo;I
      mean, was there, is there such a thing? One has heard of it; in fact it is
      a catch phrase that any portentous poseur has on the tip of his tongue.
      When one comes to examine it, however, it generally means champagne and
      oysters and an unpresentable lady, and it ends with liver and&mdash;and
      all sorts of things, don't you know. But you are not a poseur&mdash;I
      think you are the honestest man I have ever met&mdash;and yet you paint
      this creature as if you utterly believe in what he typifies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would go hard with me if I did n't,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;I can't talk to you
      in philosophic terms and explain all my reasons, because I have read very
      little philosophy. When I do try, my head gets addled. I knew a chap once
      who used to devour Berkeley and Kant and all the rest, and used to write
      about them, and I used to sit at his feet in a kind of awed wonder at the
      tremendousness of his brain. A man called Smith. He was colossally
      clever,&rdquo; he added after a reflective pause. &ldquo;But I can only grope after
      the obvious. Don't you think the beauty of the world is obvious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all depends upon which world,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which world? Why, God's world. It is sweet to draw the breath of life. I
      love living; don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never thought of it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I should n't like to die, it
      is true, but I don't know why. Most people seem to spend two-thirds of
      their existence in a state of boredom, and the rest in sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because they reject my poor faun's inheritance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been asking you what that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The joy and laughter of life. They put it from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They draw the soul's curtains and light the gas, instead of letting God's
      sunshine stream in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma turned away from the picture with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me of the first time I met you. You told me to go and
      ventilate my soul. It gave me quite a shock, I assure you. But I have been
      trying to follow your precept ever since. Don't you think I am a little
      bit fresher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the moment the girl still lingering in her five-and-twenty hard years
      flashed to the surface, adorably warming the cold, finely sculptured face,
      and bringing rare laughter into her eyes. Jimmie marvelled at the infinite
      sweetness of her, and fed his poor hungry soul thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like a midsummer morning,&rdquo; he said unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone caught her, sobered her; but the colour deepened on her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll treasure that as a pretty compliment,&rdquo; she said. There was a little
      space of silence&mdash;quite a perilous little space, with various unsaid
      things lurking in ambush. Norma broke it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I have seen everything, have n't I? No. There are some on the floor
      against the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie explained their lack of value, showed her two or three. They were
      mostly the wasters from his picture factory, he said. She found in each a
      subject for admiration, and Jimmie glowed with pleasure at her praise.
      While he was replacing them she moved across the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this one?&rdquo; she asked, with her finger on the top of a strainer. He
      looked round and followed swiftly to her side. It was her own portrait
      with its face to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to show you that,&rdquo; he said hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a crazy thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should love to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it's a crazy thing,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;A mad artist's dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma arched her eyebrows. &ldquo;Aha! That is very like a confession!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ideal woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought everything was so positive in your scheme of life,&rdquo; she
      remarked teasingly. &ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the vibration that Jimmie, poorest of actors, could not keep from
      his voice, stirred her. She felt the indelicacy of having trodden upon
      sanctified ground. She turned away and sat down. They talked of other
      matters, somewhat self-consciously. Both welcomed the entrance of Connie
      Deering and Aline. The former filled the studio at once with laughing
      chatter. She hoped Norma had not turned Jimmie's hair white with the
      dreadful things she must have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't turn a hair, as I'm a mere worldling, but Jimmie is an
      unsophisticated child of nature, and is n't accustomed to you, my dear
      Norma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on to explain that she was Jimmie's natural protectress, and that
      they who harmed him would have to reckon with her. Jimmie flew gaily to
      Norma's defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this child's garments?&rdquo; he asked, indicating Aline, whose face was
      irradiated by a vision of splendid attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't meddle with what does n't concern you,&rdquo; replied Connie, while she
      and the girl exchanged the glances of conspirators.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short while afterwards the two visitors drove away. For some time Norma
      responded somewhat absently to Mrs. Deering's light talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you have taken to Jimmie,&rdquo; said the latter at last. &ldquo;Is n't
      he a dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember your saying that before. But is n't it rather an odd word to
      use with reference to him?&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd&mdash;? But that's just what he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma turned in some resentment on her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Connie, how dare we talk patronisingly of a man like that? He's worth
      a thousand of the empty-souled, bridge-playing people we live among.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's just why I call him a dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Deering,
      uncomprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma shrugged her shoulders, fell into a silence which she broke by
      risking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know whom he is in love with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Norma,&rdquo; cried the little lady, in alarm. &ldquo;You don't say
      that Jimmie is in love? Oh, it would spoil him. He can't be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one picture&mdash;of a woman&mdash;which he would not let me
      see,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma paused for some seconds before she replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called it 'a mad artist's dream.' I have been wondering whether it was
      not better than a sane politician's reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a sane politician's reality, dear?&rdquo; Connie asked, mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, woman-like, she turned the conversation to the turpitudes of her
      dressmaker.

      Chapter X&mdash;TWO IDYLLS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>IMMIE was trudging
      along the undulating highroad that leads from Dieppe to the little village
      of Berneval, very hot, very dusty, very thirsty, and very contented. He
      carried a stick and a little black bag. His content proceeded from a
      variety of causes. In the first place it was a glorious August day,
      drenched with sunshine and with deep blue ether; and the smiling plain of
      Normandy rolled before him, a land of ripening orchards and lazy pastures.
      He had been longing for the simple beauty of sun and sky and green trees,
      and for the homely sights and sounds of country things, and now he had his
      fill. Secondly, Aline was having a much needed holiday. She had been
      growing a little pale and languid, he thought, in London, after a year's
      confined administering to his selfish wants. She was enjoying herself,
      too, and the few days she had already spent in the sea air had brought the
      blood to her cheeks again. Thirdly, he was free for the moment from
      everyday cares. A dealer had fallen from heaven into his studio and paid
      money down for the copyright of two of his worst pictures. Fourthly, he
      had definitely received the commission for the portrait of the Princess of
      Herren-Rothbeck. Her Serene Highness and her tutelary duchess had paid
      their visit, expressed themselves delighted with his work (the duchess
      especially commending the portrait of the hapless Mrs. Marmaduke Hewson),
      and had driven away in a most satisfactory condition of serenity and
      graciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie was happy. What could man want more? In addition to all these
      blessings, Norma had written to him from Lord Monzie's place in Scotland a
      letter <i>à propos</i> of nothing, merely expressive of good-will and
      friendliness; and he had received it that morning. He had never seen her
      handwriting before. Bold, incisive, distinguished, it seemed to complement
      his conception of the radiant lady, and in a foolish way he tried to
      harmonise the ink-marks with the curves of her proud lips, the setting of
      her eyes, and the poise of her queenly head. The dreariness of a rainy
      afternoon with all the men and half the women away on the grouse-moor had
      been, she said, her excuse for writing. She sketched various members of
      the house-party with light, satiric touches; notably one Theodore Weever,
      an American, whose sister had married an impecunious and embarrassing
      cousin of the Duchess of Wiltshire. He was building himself a palace in
      Fifth Avenue, wrote Norma, and had been buying pictures in Europe to
      decorate it with; now he was anxious to purchase a really decorative wife.
      Morland was expected in a few days, and she would be glad when he appeared
      upon the scene. She did not say why; but Jimmie naturally understood that
      her heart was yearning for the presence of the man she loved. &ldquo;I have very
      little to say that can interest you,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;but you can say many
      things to interest me: this letter is purely selfish, a mere minnow, after
      all, that I use as bait.&rdquo; So Jimmie walked along the dusty road thinking
      out an answer that could bring comfort to the Hero pining for her Leander;
      thinking also of Aline, and revelling in the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He delighted, like a child, in all he saw. He stopped before the red,
      gold, and green paradise of an orchard and feasted upon its colour. He
      lingered in talk with a tiny girl driving a great brown cow; asked her its
      age, how many calves it had had, its name, and whether she were not afraid
      it would mistake her for a blade of grass and bite her. The little girl
      scoffed at the possibility. She could drive three cows, and, if it came to
      that, a bull. &ldquo;<i>Ça me connaît, les bêtes,</i>&rdquo; she said. Whereupon he
      put a couple of sous in her hand and went on his way. Presently he sat
      down on the rough wooden bench in front of a wayside café and drank cider
      from an earthenware bowl, and played with a mongrel puppy belonging to the
      establishment. When the latter had darted off to bark amid the cloud of
      dust and petroleum fumes left by a passing motor-car, Jimmie, sipping his
      second bowl of sour cider in great content, re-read the precious letter,
      filled his pipe, and reflected peacefully on the great harmony of things.
      The hopelessness of his own love for Norma struck no discord. The Stephen
      so closely connected with the life of Saint Catherine of Siena did not
      love with less hope or more devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid the few coppers for his reckoning, took up his stick and little
      black bag, and trudged on refreshed, and as he neared Berneval the
      expectation of Aline's welcome gladdened him. He had rented for the month
      a cottage with a straggling piece of ground behind, from an artist friend
      whose possession it was. The friend had fixed the figure absurdly low; the
      modest living under Aline's experienced management was cheap, and the <i>bonne
      à tout faire</i> cooked divinely for a few halfpence a day. By a curious
      coincidence Mr. Anthony Merewether had also pitched upon Berneval as a
      summer resting-place. He had come on business, he gave out,
      and every morning saw him issue from the hotel by the beach, armed with
      easel and camp-stool, and the rest of the landscape-painter's
      paraphernalia, and every evening saw him smoking cigarettes on Jimmie's
      veranda. Whether the hours of sunshine saw him consistently hard at work,
      Jimmie was inclined to doubt. He certainly bathed a great deal and ran
      about with Aline a great deal, and Jimmie read the pair moral lessons on
      the evil effects of idleness. But Tony was a fresh-minded boy; his
      ingenuous conversation provided Jimmie with much entertainment, and his
      presence on their holiday gave him the satisfaction of feeling that Aline
      had some one of her own age to play with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ramshackle vehicle, half diligence, half omnibus, that plies between
      Berneval and Dieppe, passed him with great cracking of whip and straining
      of rusty harness and loud <i>hue</i>'s from the driver, just as he entered
      the village. It was late afternoon, and the trim white and green of the
      place was bathed in mellow sunshine. The short cut home lay up a lane and
      through the churchyard, a cluster of grey slabs around a little grey
      church; and many of the slabs bore the story of the pitiless sea&mdash;how
      Jean-Marie Dulac, many years ago, was drowned at the age of nineteen, and
      how Jacques Lemerre perished in a storm; for it has been from time
      immemorial a tiny village of fisher-folk and every family has given of its
      own to the waves. The pathos of the simple legends on the stones always
      touched him as he walked by; and now he paused to decipher some moss-grown
      letters of fifty years ago. He stooped, made out the same sad tale,
      moralised a little thereon, and rose with a sigh of relief to greet the
      sunshine and the fair earth. But the sight that suddenly met his eyes
      banished dead fishermen and hungry sea and sunny tree-tops from his mind.
      It was a boy and a girl very close together, his arm about her waist, her
      head upon his shoulder, walking by the little church. Their backs were
      towards him. He stared open-mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; said he, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he dropped his stick, which clattered upon a gravestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foolish pair started at the sound, assumed a correct attitude with
      remarkable swiftness, and turning, recognised Jimmie. Tony Merewether, who
      was a fair youth, grew very red and looked sheepish; Aline awaited events
      demurely, with downcast eyes. Jimmie pushed his old Homburg hat to the
      back of his head, and in two or three strides confronted them. He tried to
      look fiercely at Tony. The young man drew himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked Aline to marry me, sir,&rdquo; he said frankly. &ldquo;I was going to
      speak to you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Jimmie, helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't marry just yet,&rdquo; said Tony, &ldquo;but I hope you will give your
      consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie looked from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did n't you let me know of this state of things before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n't done anything underhand. I thought you guessed,&rdquo; said Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Aline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stole a shy glance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was n't quite sure of it until just now,&rdquo; she replied. And then she
      blushed furiously and ran to Jimmie's arms. &ldquo;Oh, Jimmie dear, don't be
      cross!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cross, my child?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world of tender reproach in his tone touched her. The ready tears
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an angel, Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand that was on her shoulder patted it comfortingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, I am a blind elderly idiot. O Lord, Tony, I hope you feel
      infernally ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Tony says, we sha'n't be able to get married for a long, long time,&rdquo;
       said Aline, by way of consolation, &ldquo;so for years and years we'll go on in
      just the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only ask you to consent to our engagement, sir,&rdquo; said Tony,
      diplomatically. &ldquo;I am quite willing to wait for Aline as long as you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The abandonment of Jimmie by Aline had been the subject of the last
      half-hour's discussion between the lovers. The thought of Jimmie alone and
      helpless appalled her. She was a horrid selfish wretch, she had informed
      Tony, for listening to a word he said. How could Jimmie live by himself?
      She shuddered at the dismal chaos of the studio, the gaping holes in his
      socks, the impossible meals, the fleecing of him by every plausible beggar
      in frock coat or rags, the empty treasury. He needed more care than a
      baby. She would marry Tony, some day, because her head was full of him,
      and because she had let him kiss her and had found a peculiar, dreamy
      happiness during the process, and because she could not conceive the
      possibility of marrying any one else. But she was more than content to
      leave the date indefinite. Perhaps, in the stretch of aeons between now
      and then, something would happen to release her from her responsibilities.
      She had made the position luminously clear to Mr. Merewether before she
      had consented to be foolish and walk about with her head on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, until Jimmie gets properly suited,&rdquo; she said, quickly following
      Tony's last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear foolish children,&rdquo; said Jimmie, &ldquo;you had better get married as
      soon as ever you can keep the wolf from the door. What on earth is the
      good of waiting till you are old? Get all the happiness you can out of
      your youth, and God bless you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give my life to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie touched him on the arm, waved his hand around, indicating the
      little grey church, the quiet graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not the place where a man should say such a thing lightly,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not the man to say such a thing lightly in any place,&rdquo; retorted the
      youth, with spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie nodded approvingly. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said to Aline, &ldquo;that is the way I
      like to hear a man talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and collected the fallen stick and the black bag which he had
      deposited by the side of the slab. He had gone into Dieppe that morning
      partly for the sake of the walk and partly to purchase some odds and ends
      for the house. Aline, not trusting to his memory, had given him a list of
      items with directions attached as to the places where he was to procure
      them, so that when he came to &ldquo;pepper,&rdquo; he should seek it at a grocery and
      not at a milliner's establishment. Now, without saying a word, he opened
      the bag and rummaged among its queer contents, which Aline regarded with
      some twinges of a tender conscience. She ought to have gone into Dieppe
      herself, and made her purchases like a notable housewife, instead of
      sending Jimmie and passing the day in selfish lovemaking. The twinge grew
      sharper when Jimmie at last fished out a little cardboard box and put it
      in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I can give you an engagement present before Tony,&rdquo; he said
      with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only an old filigree silver waist-buckle he had picked up at a
      curio shop in the town, but it was a gem of infinite value to the girl,
      for she knew that Jimmie's love went with it. She showed it to Tony
      Merewether, who admired the workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can give me anything I shall prize more, you will be a lucky
      fellow,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three strolled quietly towards the cottage, and it was Jimmie's arm
      that Aline clung to, and Mr. Merewether who carried the black bag. That
      night, after she had dismissed the young man, she sat a long time with
      Jimmie on the veranda, telling him in one shy breath of the wonder that
      had suddenly come into her life, and in the next that she would never
      leave him until he was rich and famous and able to live by himself.
      Jimmie, unguileful in the nature of men and maidens and the ways of this
      wicked world, kept on repeating like a refrain his formula of
      astonishment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never entered my head, dear, that you two children would fall in love
      with one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think I ought n't to have done it, do you, Jimmie?&rdquo; she said at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke into his happy laugh, and kissed her. &ldquo;If you want to please me,
      you'll go on doing it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time after he had gone to bed that sleep came. Yes; Nature,
      the dear mother, had spoken, and who could gainsay her? A clean, bright,
      healthy English lad, and a clean, bright, healthy English girl had read
      truth in each other's eyes. It was one of the sweet things in the world,
      for which we who live in the world should be thankful. The dimly seen
      white curtains of his bed became gossamer veils that enveloped him with
      beauty. Now, on either side, his inner life was touched by the magic of
      romance: the fair dream of these two children, and the love of the other
      betrothed pair. It was on happy eyelids that sleep settled at last. And
      Aline, too, lay awake, her young cheeks burning at the delicious yet
      frightening memory of a kiss in the little churchyard, and her heart
      swelling at the thought of the infinite goodness of Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, unconscious of these idyllic happenings and romantic
      speculations, Norma was enjoying herself in her worldly way at Lord
      Monzie's place in Scotland. Lord Monzie, a dissipated young man who had
      lately come into the title, had married a well-to-do young woman in very
      smart society. Consequently there was no lack of modern entertainment in
      the house. So modern was everything that the host had got down Mr. Joseph
      Ascherberg, the financier, to hold a roulette bank every night against all
      comers; but he took care that he himself, or his own confidential man,
      turned the wheel and spun the marble. Most of the people had unimaginative
      nicknames, the extremes of the Submerged Tenth and the Upper Ten thus
      curiously meeting. Lord Monzie was called &ldquo;Muggins;&rdquo; his bosom friend,
      and, as some whispered, his <i>âme damnée</i>, Sir Calthrop Boyle, was
      alluded to as &ldquo;The Boiler;&rdquo; and Ascherberg responded to the appellation of
      &ldquo;Freddy.&rdquo; There were also modern conveniences for the gratification of
      caprices or predilections that need not be insisted upon. In fact the
      atmosphere was surcharged with modernity; so much so that Norma, who would
      have walked about the Suburra of Imperial Rome with cynical indifference,
      gasped a little when she entered it. One or two things actually shocked
      her, at which she wondered greatly. She regarded Mr. Ascherberg with
      extreme disfavour, and winced at the women's conversation when they were
      cosily free from men. For the first day or two she held herself somewhat
      apart, preferring solitude on sequestered bits of terrace, where she could
      read a novel, or look at the grey hills that met the stretch of purple
      moorland. But gradually the sweeter tone of mind which she had brought
      with her lost its flavour, and having won sixty pounds from Ascherberg,
      and having told the feminine coterie what she knew of the Wyniard affair,
      she began to breathe the atmosphere without much difficulty. Yet
      occasionally she had spasms of revolt. In a corner of the drawing-room
      stood a marble copy of the little Laughing Faun in the Louvre, put there
      by the late baron, and every time her eye fell upon it, the picture of
      another faun arose before her, and with it the memory of a homely man with
      bright kind eyes, and she seemed to draw a breath of purer air. But she
      called the fancy foolishness and hardened her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, had it not been for Theodore Weever, the American man of affairs,
      she would probably have found some pretext for an abrupt departure. He
      alone was a personality among the characterless, vicious men and women of
      the house-party. Short, spare, alert, bald-headed, clean-shaven,
      clear-featured, he was of a type apart. Norma, who had a keen
      intelligence, divined in him from the first an adversary upon whom she
      could sharpen her wit and a companion who would not bore her with dreary
      tales of sport or the unprofitable details of his last night's play. And
      from the first Theodore Weever was attracted towards Norma. Their lax
      associates, in spite of her engagement to Morland being perfectly well
      known and in spite of Morland's expected arrival, recognised their pairing
      with embarrassing frankness, and said appalling things about them behind
      their backs. For a few days therefore they found themselves inseparable.
      At last their friendship reached the confidential stage. Mr. Theodore
      Weever avowed the object of his present visit to England. He was in search
      of a decorative wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be as easy as turning over a book of wallpapers,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as difficult to choose,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know what scheme of colouring and design you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. I don't find it in the books of stock patterns, either here or
      in America. And I've ransacked America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is n't the line&mdash;I believe in commercial circles they call it a line&mdash;is
      n't the line of specially selected duchesses for the English market good
      enough for you?&rdquo; she asked with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to light a cigarette when she began her question. He lit it
      and blew out the first few puffs of smoke before he replied. They were
      sitting in Norma's favourite nook on the terrace, where he, solitary male
      who had not gone forth with a gun that morning, had been gratuitously told
      by an obliging hostess that he would find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The American woman makes a good decorative duchess,&rdquo; he said in his
      incisive tone, &ldquo;because she has to sweep herself clean of every tradition
      she was born with and accept bodily the very much bigger and more dazzling
      tradition of your old aristocracy. She can do it, because she is
      infinitely sensitive and intelligent. But she is a changed creature. She
      has to live up to her duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He puffed for a moment or two at his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see what I am coming to?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I am not an English duke.
      I am a plain American citizen. No woman in America would make it her ideal
      in life to live up to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to be rude,&rdquo; interrupted Norma, with a laugh, &ldquo;but do you
      think any Englishwoman would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Not to this insignificant, baldheaded thing that is
      I, but to what in the way of position and power I represent. An American
      woman would bring her traditions along with her&mdash;her superior
      culture, her natural right to be enthroned as queen, her expectation that
      I would take a back seat in my own house. It is I that would become a sort
      of grotesque decoration in the place. Now, I may be grotesque, but I will
      not consent to be decorative. I fully intend to be master. I am not going
      to be Mrs. Theodore Weever's husband. I want an Englishwoman to bring
      along her traditions. She will be naturally <i>grande dame</i>; she will
      come to my house, my social world, frankly the wife of Theodore Weever,
      and ready to support the dignity, whatever it may be, of Theodore Weever,
      just as she would have supported the dignity of Lord So and So, had she
      been married to him in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find thousands of English girls who can do that,&rdquo; said Norma. &ldquo;I
      don't see your difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be decorative,&rdquo; said Weever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be a queenly woman, but one content to be queen consort. Your
      queenly woman&mdash;with brains&mdash;is not so easy to find. I have met
      only one in my life who is beyond all my dreams of the ideal. Of course
      the inherent malice of things screws her down like one blade of a pair of
      scissors to another fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the paragon?&rdquo; asked Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't be fair on the other fellow to tell you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it sheer honesty, or the fear of being cut in half by the pair of
      scissors that keeps you from coming between them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's honesty,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If I can guess rightly, the scissors
      have n't so fine an edge on them as to make them dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may be desperately in love with one another, for all you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are delightful worldlings of our own particular world, dear lady,&rdquo;
       said Weever, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was Norma given to understand that the post of decorative queen
      consort in Mr. Theodore Weever's Fifth Avenue palace was at her disposal.
      A year ago she might have considered the offer seriously; now that she
      felt secure of a brilliant position as Morland's wife, she was amused by
      its frank impudence. She held other laughing conversations with him on the
      subject of his search, but too prudent to commit indiscretions, she gave
      no hint that she had understood his personal allusion, and Weever was too
      shrewd to proceed any further towards his own undoing. They remained
      paired, however, to their mutual satisfaction, until Morland's arrival,
      when Theodore Weever took his departure. In fact, the same carriage that
      conveyed the American to the station remained for a necessary half-hour to
      meet Morland's train, and Norma, who dutifully drove down to welcome her
      affianced, shared the carriage with the departing guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood on the platform chatting with him as he leaned out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall we see each other again?&rdquo; she said idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; she asked, somewhat taken aback by his decided tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am putting in some time at Chiltern Towers. I had a letter this morning
      from the duchess, asking me to come and meet the Princess of
      Herren-Rothbeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other, and Norma laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of Her Serene Highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've had dealings with her before,&rdquo; replied Weever. &ldquo;I reckon I get
      my money's worth. Don't you fret about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard came up and touched his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are off now, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands with Weever, saying with a laugh, &ldquo;I hope you will find
      that bit of decoration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you fret about that, either,&rdquo; he said with a quick, hard glance.
      &ldquo;I'm in no hurry. I can wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train started, and was soon swallowed by a tunnel a few hundred yards
      up the line. Norma patrolled the platform of the little wayside station
      waiting for Morland. The place was very still. The only porter had
      departed somewhither. The station-master had retired into his office. The
      coachman outside the station sat like a well-bred image on his box, and
      the occasional clink of the harness, as the horses threw up their heads,
      sounded sharp and clear. Nothing around but mountain and moorland; a short
      distance in front a ravine with a lazily trickling, half-dried-up mountain
      stream. Here and there a clump of larch and fir, and a rough granite
      boulder. An overcast sky threw dreariness on the silent waste. Norma
      shivered, suddenly struck with a sense of isolation. She seemed to stand
      in the same relation with her soul's horizon as with the physical
      universe. The man that had gone had left her with a little feeling of fear
      for the future, a little after-taste of bitterness. The man that was
      coming would bring her no thrill of joy. As she stood between a drab sky
      and a bleak earth, so stood she utterly alone in the still pause between a
      past and a future equally unillumined. She longed for the sun to break out
      of the heaven, for the sounds of joyous things to come from plain and
      mountain; and she longed for light and song in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been watching for the past few days the proceedings of a
      half-recognised, irregular union. The woman was the frivolous, heartless,
      almost passionless wife of a casual husband at the other end of the earth;
      the man an underbred fellow on the stock exchange. She ordered him about
      and called him Tommy. He clothed her in extravagant finery, and openly
      showed her his sovereign male's contempt. Norma had overheard him tell her
      to go to the devil and leave him alone, when she hinted one night, in a
      whisper that was meant for his ears alone, that he was drinking overmuch
      whisky. It was all so sordid, so vulgar&mdash;the bond between them so
      unsanctified by anything like tenderness, chivalry, devotion. Norma had
      felt the revulsion of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would be the future? By any chance like this woman's life? Would the
      day come when she would sell herself for a gown and a bracelet, thrown at
      her with a man's contemptuous word? Was marriage very widely different
      from such a union? Was not she selling herself? Might not the man she was
      waiting for go the way of so many others of his type, drink and coarsen
      and tell her to go to the devil?
    </p>
    <p>
      She longed for the sun, but not a gleam pierced the leaden sky; she sought
      in her soul for a ray of light, but none came.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last with a shriek and a billowing plume of smoke the down train
      emerged from the tunnel. Norma set her face in its calm ironic mask and
      waited for the train to draw up. Only two passengers alighted, Morland and
      his man. Morland came to her with smiling looks and grasped her by the
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking more beautiful than ever,&rdquo; he whispered, bringing his
      face close to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started back as if she had been struck. The fumes of brandy were in
      his breath. Her hideous forebodings were in process of fulfilment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole station will hear you,&rdquo; she said coldly, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Imp of Mischance rubbed his hands gleefully at his contrivance.
      Morland, a temperate man, had merely felt chilly after an all-night's
      journey, and, more out of idleness than from a desire for alcohol, had
      foolishly taken a sip out of his brandy flask a moment or two before, when
      he was putting up his hand-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma collected herself, summoned with bitter cynicism her common-sense to
      her aid, and made smiling amends for her shrewish remark. She suffered him
      to kiss her on the drive home, and strove not to despise herself.

      Chapter XI&mdash;DANGER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>EDDON COURT had
      been purchased by a wealthy Hardacre at the beginning of the nineteenth
      century, and was exhibited by his grandnephew, the present occupant, as a
      gem of Georgian architecture. Mr. Hardacre had but a vague idea what the
      definition meant, but it sounded very impressive. As a matter of fact, it
      was a Palladian stone building, with pediments over the windows and severe
      rustication on the lower courses. As none of the succeeding Hardacres had
      any money to devote to extensions, the building had remained in its
      original perfection of formality, and Mr. Hardacre did well to be proud of
      it. The grounds had been laid out in the Italian style; but the tastes
      and fashions of over a hundred years had caused the classic architect's
      design to be practically indiscernible. A lawn with trim flower-beds,
      bounded by an arc of elm-trees and bordered by a circular carriage drive
      faced the south front. Along the east front ran a series of terraces. The
      highest, a foot or two below the level of the drawing-room floor, ended on
      the north in a porticoed temple, now used as an afternoon lounge, and
      incongruously furnished with rugs and frivolous wickerwork chairs and
      tables. The next terrace, some eight feet below, was devoted to a tennis
      court. A thick hedge of clipped yew and a screen of wire netting hid the
      lowest, the most charming of all, which, surrounded on all sides by a
      sloping bank and flanked on three sides by tall trees, had been delicately
      turfed for a bowling-green and was now used for croquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this stately paradise, warmed by sunny September weather, Jimmie had
      already spent two or three blissful days. His only regret was the absence
      of Aline. She had been invited, but for reasons in which doubtless Tony
      Merewether had a place, she had declined the invitation. She gave Jimmie
      to understand that she had already had her holiday, that the house could
      not possibly look after itself any longer, and that she had no clothes fit
      to appear in among his grand friends. The last argument being
      unanswerable, save by contentions at which the young woman tossed a
      superior head, Jimmie had yielded and come down alone. His regret,
      however, was tempered by the reflection that Aline was probably enjoying
      herself after the manner of betrothed maidens, and it did not seriously
      affect his happiness. Either chance or the lady's own sweet courtesy
      towards a guest had caused him to see much of Norma. She had driven him
      over to Chiltern Towers, where the sittings had begun. She had walked with
      him to Cosford to show him the beautiful fourteenth-century church with
      its decorated spire. She had strolled with him up and down the croquet
      lawn. She had chatted with him in the morning-room yesterday for a whole
      rainy hour after lunch. His head was full of her beauty and condescension.
      It was not unnatural that they should be thrown much together. Morland's
      day was taken up by partridges and electors. Mr. Hardacre, honestly afraid
      of Jimmie, not knowing what on earth to talk to him about, and only half
      comprehending his conversation, kept out of his way as much as his duties
      as host would allow, and Mrs. Hardacre, who, though exceedingly civil, had
      not forgotten her defeat in the studio, felt justified in leaving his
      entertainment in the hands of others who professed to admire the creature.
      These were Norma, Morland, and Connie Deering.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon they found themselves again alone together, at tea in the
      classic temple at the end of the terrace. Mrs. Hardacre and Connie had
      driven off to pay a call, and the men were shooting over ducal turnips.
      Jimmie had received an invitation to join the shooting-party, but not
      having handled a gun since boyish days (and even then Jimmie with firearms
      was Morland's conception of the terror that walketh by day), and also
      having an appointment with the princess for a second sitting, he had
      declined, and Morland, when he heard of it, had clapped him on the back
      and expressed his fervent gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie had been narrating his morning's adventures at Chiltern Towers, and
      explaining the point of view from which he was painting the portrait. It
      was to be that of the very great lady, with the blood of the earth's great
      rulers in her veins. It was to be half full-length, just showing the
      transparent, aristocratic hands set off by rich old lace at the wrists. A
      certain acidity of temper betrayed by the pinched nostrils and thin lips
      he would try to modify, as it would be out of keeping with his basic
      conception. Norma listened, interested more in the speaker than in the
      subject, her mind occasionally wandering, as it had been wont to do of
      late, to a comparison of ideals. Since that half-hour's loneliness on the
      platform of the little Highland station, she had passed through many hours
      of unrest. To-day the mood had again come upon her. A talk with her mother
      about the great garden-party they were giving in two days' time, to which
      the princess and the duchess were coming, had aroused her scorn; a casual
      phrase of Morland's in reference to the election had jarred upon her; a
      sudden meeting in Cosford with Theodore Weever, and a laughing reference
      to the decorative wife had brought back the little shiver of fear. The
      only human being in the world who could settle her mood&mdash;and now she
      felt it consciously&mdash;was this odd, sweet-natured man who seemed to
      live in a beautiful world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he talked she listened, and her mind wandered from the subject. She
      thought of his life, his surroundings, of the girl whose love affair he
      had told her of so tenderly. She took advantage of a pause, occasioned by
      the handing of a second cup of tea and the judicious choosing of cake, to
      start the new topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Aline is very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie laughed. &ldquo;What put my little girl into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking a good deal about her since you wrote of her
      engagement. Is it really such an idyll?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The love of two sweet, clean young people is always idyllic. It is so
      untainted&mdash;pure as a mountain spring; There is nothing quite like it
      in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are they going to set up house together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will miss her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jimmie, &ldquo;enormously. But the thoughts of her happiness
      will keep me pleasant company. I shall get on all right. Meanwhile it is
      beautiful to see her. She does n't know that I watch, but I do. It is
      sweet to see her eyes brighten and her cheeks flush and to hear her
      laughter. It is like stepping for an enchanted moment into a fairy-tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could step into it&mdash;just for one enchanted moment,&rdquo; said
      Norma..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; asked Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been in one in my life. I disbelieved in them till you came
      like an apostle of fairyland and converted me. Now I want the consolations
      of my faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An earnest note in her voice surprised him. She did not meet his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps you would,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You seem to understand most
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have your own&mdash;happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated on the word. A quick glance assured her of his ingenuousness.
      She longed to undeceive him, to shriek out her heartlessness, her contempt
      for herself and for her life. But pride and loyalty to Morland restrained
      her within bounds of sanity. She assented to his proposition with a
      gesture of the shapely hand that lay on the tea-table absently tracing the
      pattern of the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have that. But it isn't the fairyland of those two children. You
      yourself say there is nothing like it in the world. You don't know how I
      pine for it sometimes&mdash;for the things that are sweet and clean and
      untainted and pure as a mountain spring. They don't come my way. They
      never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;Love will bring them all to you&mdash;that
      and a perfect wedded life and little children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a flash she raised her eyes and looked full into his, and for the
      first time the love in the man's heart surged tumultuously. It rose of a
      sudden, without warning, flooding his being, choking him. What it was of
      yearning, despair, passion, horror that he saw in her eyes he knew not. He
      did not read in them the craving of a starved soul for food. To him their
      burning light was a mystery. All that ever reached his consciousness was
      that it was a look such as he had never before beheld in a woman's face;
      and against his will and against his reason it acted like some dark
      talisman and unlocked floodgates. He clenched the arms of the wickerwork
      chair, and bit his lip hard, and stared at the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma broke into a hard laugh, and lay back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be thinking me a great fool,&rdquo; she said, in her usual mocking
      tones. &ldquo;When a woman tries to swim in sentiment, she flounders, and either
      drowns or has to be lugged ignominiously to shore. She can't swim like a
      man. Thanks for the rescue, Mr. Padgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm back on dry land. Oh! it is safer for me. There I am protected by my
      little bodyguard of three&mdash;the World, the Flesh, and the Devil. I
      can't get on without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie leaped from his chair and brought his clenched hands down to his
      sides in a passionate gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop talking like that, I say!&rdquo; he cried imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then meeting her scared and indignant glance, he bowed somewhat wide of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of no great apology, and marched
      out of the little temple and along the gravelled walk of the terrace.
      Flight, or the loss of self-control, was his only alternative. What she
      thought of him he did not care. The sense of increasing distance from her
      alone brought security to his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the further end he met Mrs. Deering just back from her drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is the matter, Jimmie?&rdquo; she asked, twirling an idle sunshade
      over her pretty head, for the terrace was in deep afternoon shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied, with a ghastly attempt at a smile. &ldquo;I am going for
      a walk before dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left her standing, reached the highroad and pounded along it. What a
      fool he had been! What a mad fool he had been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Deering, with a puzzled expression on her face, watched him
      disappear. She turned and strolled down to Norma, who greeted her with a
      satiric smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing to Jimmie?&rdquo; asked Mr. Deering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been giving him lessons in worldly wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear! They seem to have disagreed with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;That's his affair, not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say that you and Jimmie have quarrelled?&rdquo; laughed
      Connie. &ldquo;How delightful! I've always wanted to quarrel with Jimmie just
      for the pleasure of kissing and making friends. But it has been
      impossible. Is it serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Norma answered; and then after a pause, &ldquo;Oh, Connie, I'm
      afraid I've been a positive brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which evidence of a salutary conviction of her own wrongdoing shows that
      Jimmie's amazing shout of command had not aroused within her any furious
      indignation. Indeed, after the first moment of breathless astonishment,
      she had expressed an odd, almost amusing thrill of admiration for the man
      who had dared address her in that fashion. It was only a small feminine
      satisfaction in the knowledge that by going away he would punish himself
      for his temerity that had restrained her from summoning him back. As soon
      as he was out of call, she reproached herself for misconduct. She could
      have strangled the wanton devil that had prompted her cynical speech. And
      yet the same devil had saved an embarrassing situation. Wedded life and
      little children! If she had spoken what was trembling on her lips, how
      could she have looked the man in the face again? Her sex was revolting
      against that very prospect, was clamouring wildly for she knew not what.
      She dared not betray herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She greeted him smilingly in the drawing-room before dinner, as if nothing
      had occurred, and chatted pleasantly with Morland over his day's fortunes.
      Jimmie observed her with a sigh of relief. He had passed the last two
      hours greatly agitated; he had trembled lest he had revealed to her his
      soul's secret, and also lest his unmannerliness had given unpardonable
      offence. In any case, now he saw himself forgiven, and breathed freely.
      But he remained unusually silent during dinner, and spent most of the
      evening in the billiard-room with Mr. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman, joining the ladies later, fell into conversation with his
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is Padgate going to stay?&rdquo; he asked, mopping his forehead with
      his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till the princess has completed her sittings, I suppose,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish she'd be quick. I don't know what to do with the fellow. Does n't
      shoot, can't play billiards worth a cent, and does n't seem to know
      anybody. It's like talking to a chap that does n't understand your
      language. I've just been at it. Happened to say I'd like to go to Rome
      again. He fetches a sigh and says so should he. 'Some of the best
      wild-duck shooting in the world,' I said. He stared at me for a moment as
      if I were an escaped lunatic. Now, what on earth should a reasonable being
      go to that beastly place for except to shoot wild-duck on the marshes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma laughed the little mocking laugh that always irritated her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need n't be afraid of not entertaining Mr. Padgate. He must have
      enjoyed the conversation hugely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damme&mdash;if the fellow is laughing at me&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not be the very fine gentleman that he is,&rdquo; said Norma. &ldquo;Where
      is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morland relieved guard in the billiard-room, when the post came in,&rdquo;
       growled Mr. Hardacre, who shrank from crossing swords with his daughter,
      and indeed with anybody. &ldquo;He is happy enough with Morland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that particular moment, however, there was not overmuch happiness in
      the billiard-room. A letter from Aline had been accompanied by one for
      &ldquo;David Rendell, Esquire&rdquo; which she had enclosed. Morland read it, and
      crushed it angrily into the pocket of his dinner-jacket, and began to
      knock the balls about in an aimless way. Jimmie watched him anxiously and,
      as he did not speak, unfolded his own letter from Aline. Suddenly he rose
      from the divan where he had been sitting and approached the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something here that you ought to know, Morland. A man has been
      enquiring for you at my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why should n't he?&rdquo; asked Morland, making a savage shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He enquired for David Rendell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland threw down his cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid Aline, who is a miracle of sagacity as a general rule, has
      made a mess of it. You mustn't be angry with my poor little girl. Her head
      is full of sweeter things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has she done?&rdquo; Morland asked impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll read: 'I told him that Mr. Rendell was a friend of yours, and gave
      him your present address. He muttered something about a false name and
      went away without thanking me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Morland, &ldquo;what damned fools women are! Did she say what
      kind of a man he was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie looked through the letter, and finding the passage, read: &ldquo;'An
      odd-looking creature, like a mad Methodist parson!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland uttered an exclamation of anger and apprehension. His brow grew
      black, and his florid comely features coarsened into ugliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. It could n't have been any one else. He was the only person
      who knew. She has given me away nicely. The devil only knows what will
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie leant up against the table and folded his arms, and looked at
      Morland moving restlessly to and fro and giving vent to his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this man you seem to be so afraid of?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland stopped upon the unpleasant word, then shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose I am afraid of him. One can't reckon upon anything that he
      might or might not do. He's like a mad cat. I've seen him. So have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that socialist maniac you dragged me to hear one Sunday in Hyde
      Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Jimmie. He remembered the look in the orator's eyes, his
      crazy, meaningless words, his fierce refusal to enter into friendly talk;
      also Morland's impatient exclamation and abrupt departure as soon as they
      had learned the man's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's as mad as a hatter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If he should take it into his head to
      come down here and make a row, there will be the deuce to pay,&rdquo; said
      Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie reflected for a moment. The man, with his wild talk of maidens
      lashed to the chariot-wheels of the rich, must have been tortured by the
      sense of some personal wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he come into the story?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You had better tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The usual way. Oh, I wish to God I had never got into this mess! A man of
      position is an infernal fool to go rotting about after that sort of thing.
      Oh, don't you see? He had a crazy passion for her, was engaged to her&mdash;he
      was mad then. When I came along, he had to drop it, and he has been
      persecuting her ever since&mdash;divided between the desire to marry her
      in spite of everything, and to murder me. That's why I had the assumed
      name and false address. I would n't have let you in for this bother, but I
      could n't go and run the risk of being blackmailed at a confounded little
      stationer's shop up a back street. He has been trying to get on my track
      all the time&mdash;and now he's succeeded, thanks to Aline. Why the devil
      could n't she hold her tongue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she is an innocent child, who has never dreamed of evil,&rdquo; said
      Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland walked about the room, agitated, for a few moments, then halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know, Jimmie. She is n't to blame. Besides, the mischief is
      done, so it's no use talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you thinking of any such possibility in the summer when you asked me
      to help you?&rdquo; said Jimmie. Morland cast a quick, hopeful glance at his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of the sort. One never knows. You were the only man I could
      rely on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does this man know you by sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are you so afraid of? Look here, my dear old boy,&rdquo; he said
      cheerily, &ldquo;you are being frighted by false fire. If it is only a question
      of dealing with the man when he comes here&mdash;that is, supposing he
      does come&mdash;which is very unlikely, I will tackle him as the only
      person who knows anything about David Rendell. I'll tell him David Rendell
      is in Scotland or Honolulu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is on the track of the false name,&rdquo; said Morland, uneasily. &ldquo;Aline
      mentions that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is bound to come to me first,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;I'll fix him. We'll get
      on capitally together. There's a freemasonry between lunatics. Leave it
      all to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; cried Morland, in great eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;Let us go upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed out of the billiard-room in silence. On their way to the
      drawing-room Morland murmured in a shamefaced way his apologia. He was
      just at the beginning of his electoral campaign. It was his own county. He
      was hand in glove with the duchess, sovereign lady of these parts, and she
      never forgave a scandal. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to quote your own words, it
      would break Norma's heart.&rdquo; Also, employing the limited vocabulary of his
      class and type, he reiterated the old assurance that he had not been a
      beast. He had done all that a man could to make amends. If Jimmie had not
      loved him so loyally, he would have seen something very pitiful in these
      excuses; but convinced that Morland had atoned as far as lay in his power
      for his fault, he trembled for the happiness of only those dear to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma met them on the drawing-room landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was coming down to see what had become of you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been the culprit. I restore him to you,&rdquo; laughed Jimmie. He
      entered the room and closed the door. The betrothed pair stood for a
      moment in an embarrassed silence. She laid a hesitating hand on his
      sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morland&mdash;&rdquo; she said diffidently. &ldquo;I was really wanting to have a
      little talk with you. Somehow we don't often see one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland, surprised at the softness in her voice, led her back to the
      billiard-room.

    <h2>
      Chapter XII&mdash;NORMA'S ENLIGHTENMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE development of
      the germ of goodness in woman may be measured by her tendency towards
      self-sacrifice. Even the most selfish of her sex, provided she has some
      rudimentary virtues, hugs close to her bosom some pet little thorn which
      she loves to dig into her shrinking flesh. She enjoys some odd little
      mortification, some fantastic humiliation, that is known only to the inner
      chamber of her soul. Your great-hearted woman practises Suttee daily,
      greatly to the consternation of an observant yet unperceptive husband.
      Doubtless this characteristic has a sexual basis, psychological perhaps
      rather than directly physiological, being an instinctive assertion of the
      fundamental principle of passivity, which in its turn is translated into
      the need to be held down and subdued. Thus, if the man does not beat her,
      she will beat herself; if he is a fool, she will often apply caustic to
      her wisdom, so that she may reverence him; if he is a knave, she will
      choke her honesty. Side by side with the assertion of this principle, and
      indeed often inextricably confused with it, is the maternal impulse, which
      by manifold divergences from its primary manifestation causes women to
      find a joy, uncomprehended by men, in pangs of suffering. The higher the
      type the stronger the impulse towards this sweet self-martyrdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some such theory alone explains the softer tones in Norma's voice when she
      spoke to Morland. She had passed through two periods of sharp development&mdash;the
      half-hour in Scotland and the hours she had spent since her talk with
      Jimmie that afternoon. She acted blindly, obeying an imperative voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down together on the raised divan. She was dressed in black, with
      a bunch of yellow roses at her bosom, and her neck and arms gleamed white
      in the shadow cast by the green shades over the billiard-table. Her face
      had softened. She was infinitely desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking over our relations, Morland,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps I
      have been wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked in some alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you when you asked me to marry you that it would be wise to put
      sentiment aside. You agreed, against your will, and have observed the
      convention very loyally. But I have not treated you well. In putting
      sentiment aside I was, perhaps, wrong. That is what I wanted to say to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see that I understand you, Norma,&rdquo; said Morland. &ldquo;You wish that we
      should be more like&mdash;like ordinary lovers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might try,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited. Heaven knows what she waited for; but it did not come. The Imp
      of Mischance again scored his point. The man's mind was filled with the
      thoughts of another woman in her agony and of a crazy avenger coming with
      murder in his heart. He took her hand mechanically and raised it to his
      lips. Her yielding to the caress told him that he could throw his arms
      around her and treat her loverwise; her words told him that he ought to do
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he did not. For the moment he was passionless; and to men of his type
      is not given the power, possessed by men of imaginative temperament, of
      simulating passion. He forced a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you think we might begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on bravely with her self-imposed task of submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that the man generally takes the initiative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her on the cheek. To do less would have been outrageous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you realise that I am in love with you, at last,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that you are in love with me?&rdquo; she asked, the chill that had
      fallen upon her after the lack of response to her first whisper growing
      colder and colder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I wanted to hear. Good-night,&rdquo; she said in an odd voice. She
      rose and put out her hand. Morland opened the door for her to pass and
      closed it behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma went straight to her room, feeling as though she had been tied by
      the heels to a cart-tail and dragged through the mud. Half undressed, she
      dismissed her maid summarily. Every place on her body that the girl's
      fingers touched seemed to be a bruise. She went to bed stupefied with
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Morland rang for whisky and soda, and cursed all that
      appertained to him, knowing that he had missed an amazing opportunity.
      After the way of feeble men, he thought of a hundred things he might have
      said and done that would have brought her to his feet. Had he not been
      watching patiently, ever since his engagement, for her to put off her
      grand airs, and become a woman like the rest of them? He should have said
      the many things he had often said to others. Or, if words were difficult,
      why in the world had he not kissed her properly after the manner accepted
      by women as the infallible argument? He conjured up the exceeding
      pleasantness of such an act. He could feel the melting of her lips, the
      yielding of her bosom; gradually he worked himself into a red-hot desire.
      A sudden resolve took him upstairs. There he learned that Norma had
      retired for the night, and returning to his whisky in the billiard-room,
      he cursed himself more loudly than before. A hand thrust into the pocket
      of his dinner-jacket met the poor girl's crumpled letter. Mechanically he
      took it to the empty grate, and then cursed the fire for not being lit.
      When Mr. Hardacre came down for a final game of billiards, he found his
      future son-in-law in an irritable temper, and won an easy game. Rallied
      upon his lack of form, Morland explained that the damned election was
      getting on his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n't get on them when you were shooting to-day,&rdquo; said Mr. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made believe that the birds were the beastly voters,&rdquo; replied Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma had not yet come down the next morning when he started for Cosford
      on electioneering business. Nor did he meet her, as he hoped, in the town,
      carrying on the work of canvassing which she had begun with great success.
      A dry barrister having been sent down to contest the division in the
      Liberal interest, was not making much headway in a constituency devoted to
      the duchess and other members of the tyrannical classes, and thus the task
      of Norma and her fellow-canvassers was an easy one. Today, however, she
      did not appear. Morland consoled himself with the assurance that he would
      put things right in the evening. After all, it was easy enough to kiss a
      woman who had once shown a desire to be made love to. Every man has his
      own philosophy of woman. This was Morland's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie also started upon his morning's pursuits without seeing Norma. He
      was somewhat relieved; for he had spent a restless night, dozing off only
      to dream grotesque dreams of the mad orator and waking to fight with
      beasts that gnawed his vitals. He came down unstrung, a haggard mockery of
      himself, and he was glad not to meet her clear eyes. The three-mile walk
      to Chiltern Towers refreshed him, his work on the portrait absorbed his
      faculties, and his neighbours at the ducal luncheon-table, to which the
      duchess in person had invited him, clear-witted women in the inner world
      of politics and diplomacy, kept his attention at straining point. It was
      only when he walked back to Heddon Court, although he made a manful
      attempt to whistle cheerily, that he felt heavy upon his heart the burden
      of the night. It was a languorous September afternoon, and the tired hush
      of dying summer had fallen upon the world. The smell of harvest, the sense
      of golden fulfilment of life hung on the air. Jimmie swung his stick
      impatiently, and filled his lungs with a draught of the mellow warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old earth is good. By God, it's good!&rdquo; he cried aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brave words of a resolute optimism; but they did not lighten his burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the house. Beneath an umbrella-tent on the front lawn sat
      Norma, her hands listlessly holding a closed book on her lap. Jimmie would
      have lifted his hat and passed her by, but with, a brightening face she
      summoned him. They talked awhile of commonplace things. Then, after a
      pause, she asked him, half mockingly, to account for his behaviour the day
      before. Why had he rated her in that masterful way?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bear you to speak evilly of yourself,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, since I deserve it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>you</i> that you sometimes take a pleasure in assuming to be may
      deserve it. The real you does n't. And it is the real you that I know&mdash;that
      has given me friendship and is going to marry my dearest friend. The other
      you is a phantom of a hollow world in which circumstances have placed
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the phantom is happier than the reality,&rdquo; said Norma, with a
      laugh. &ldquo;'The dream is better than the drink.' The hollow world is the
      safer place, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where imagination doth not corrupt and enthusiasms do not break in and
      steal,&rdquo; said Jimmie, with unusual bitterness. &ldquo;I have seen very little of
      it&mdash;but you have told me things,&rdquo; he continued lamely, &ldquo;and your
      being in it and of it seems a profanation. When you wilfully identify
      yourself with its ideals, you hurt me; and when I am hurt, I cry out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you care so much about what I am and what I am not?&rdquo; she
      asked in a tone half of genuine enquiry and half of expectancy, wholly
      kind and soft..
    </p>
    <p>
      He dug the point of his stick into the turf and did not raise his eyes. He
      knew now what a fool's game of peril he was playing, and kept himself in
      check. Yet his voice trembled as he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morland is very dear to me. You, his future wife, have grown dear to me
      also. I suppose I have lived rather a simple sort of life and take my
      emotions seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you thank God for it,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swift rattle of a carriage turning into the drive broke the talk,
      which had grown too personal to be left voluntarily. Jimmie felt
      infinitely grateful to the visitors, like a man suddenly saved from a
      threatening precipice. Leaving Norma with a bow, he fled into the house
      and selecting a book from the library, went onto the terrace. He needed
      solitude. Something of which he was unaware was happening. Circumstances
      were not the same as when he had first arrived. Then he had looked on
      Norma with brave serenity. He was happy, loving her and receiving frank
      friendship from her condescending hands. Now it was growing to be a pain
      to watch her face, a dread to hear her voice. Sweet intercourse had become
      a danger. And a few days had brought about the change. Why? Of the riot in
      the woman's nature he knew nothing. In his blank ignorance, seeking the
      cause within himself, he asked, Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the tennis lawn, went through the little opening at the end of
      the hedge, and down to the seclusion of the croquet ground. Half-way along
      the sloping bank beneath the upper terrace some one had left a rug. He
      threw himself upon it, and tried like many another poor fool to reason
      down his hunger. But all the sensitive nerves with which the imaginative
      man, for his curse or his blessing, is endowed, were vibrating from head
      to foot. Her words sang in his ears: &ldquo;Why should you care so much about
      what I am and what I am not?&rdquo; The real answer burst passionately from his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lain there for about half an hour when a gay little laugh aroused
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You idyllic creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Connie Deering, bewitchingly apparelled, a dainty, smiling pale
      yellow butterfly, holding as usual an absurd parasol over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been looking for you all over the place,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;They told
      me you were somewhere about the grounds. May I sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made room for her on the rug, and taking the parasol from her hand,
      closed it. She settled herself gracefully by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat I have been looking for you,&rdquo; she said.
 </p>
    <p>
&ldquo;The overpowering sense
      of honour done me has deprived me of speech,&rdquo; replied Jimmie, with an
      attempted return to his light-hearted manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norma is entertaining those dreadful Spencer-Temples,&rdquo; said Mrs. Deering,
      irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have had a premonition of their terrors, for I fled from before
      their path,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After all, poor people, what have they done to be
      called names?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are ugly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, yet people don't run away from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you run away from them,&rdquo; she said with a significant nod. &ldquo;I was at
      my bedroom window. They spoiled a most interesting little conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie was startled. He looked at her keenly, but only met laughing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They interrupted me certainly. But I could n't have inflicted my society
      on Miss Hardacre all the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have liked to, wouldn't you? Jimmie dear,&rdquo; she said with a
      change of tone, &ldquo;I want to have a talk with you. I'm the oldest woman
      friend you have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by far the sweetest and kindest and prettiest and fascinatingest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tapped his hand with her fingers. &ldquo;Ssh! I'm serious, awfully serious.
      I've never been so serious in my life before. I've got a duty. I don't
      often have it, but when I do, it's a terrible matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go and have it extracted at once, Connie,&rdquo; he laughed,
      determined to keep the talk in a frivolous channel. But the little lady
      was determined also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie dear,&rdquo; she said, holding up her forefinger, &ldquo;I am afraid you are
      running into danger. I want to warn you. An old friend can do that, can't
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can say anything you like to me, Connie. But I don't know what you
      mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suspected her meaning, however, only too shrewdly, and his heart beat
      with apprehension. Had he been fool enough to betray his secret?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are n't you getting just a little too fond of Norma, Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could n't get too fond of her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;seeing that she is to be
      Morland's wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just why you must n't. Come, Jimmie, have n't you fallen a bit in
      love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said with some heat. &ldquo;Certainly not. How dare I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kindness and teasing were in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear husband used to say I had the brain of a bird, but I may
      have the sharp eyes of a bird as well. Come&mdash;not just one little bit
      in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had sought him with the best intentions in the world. She had long
      suspected; yesterday and to-day had given her certainty. She would put him
      on his guard, talk to him like an elder sister, pour forth upon him her
      vast wisdom in affairs of the heart, and finally persuade him-from his
      folly to more sensible courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sha'n't come to grief over Norma if I can prevent it,&rdquo; she had said to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in spite of her altruistic resolve, she could not resist the
      pleasure of teasing him. She had done so all her life. Her method became
      less elder-sisterly than she had intended. But she was miles from
      realising that she touched bare nerves, and that the man was less a man
      than a living pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I'm not in love with her, Connie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How could I dream
      of loving her? It would be damnable folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jimmie, Jimmie,&rdquo; she said, enjoying his confusion, &ldquo;what a miserably
      poor liar you make&mdash;and what a precious time you would have in the
      witness-box if you were a co-respondent! You can't deceive for nuts. You
      had better confess and have done with it.&rdquo; Then seeing something of the
      anguish on his face, she bethought her of the serious aspect of her
      mission. &ldquo;I could not bear you to break your heart over Norma, dear,&rdquo; she
      said quite softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't madden me, Connie&mdash;you don't know what you are saying,&rdquo; he
      muttered below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie Deering had never heard a man speak in agony of spirit. Her lot had
      fallen among pleasant places, where life was a smooth, shaven lawn and
      emotions not more violent than the ripples on a piece of ornamental water.
      His tone gave her a sudden fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do love her, then?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie, drawing himself up in a tight, awkward heap on the
      slope. &ldquo;My God, yes, I do love her. I love her with every fibre of brain
      and body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were out. More came. He could not restrain them. He gave up the
      attempt, surrendered himself to the drunkenness of his passion, poured out
      a torrent of riotous speech. What he said he knew not. Such divine madness
      comes to a man but few times in a life. The sweet-hearted, frivolous
      woman, sitting there in the trim little paradise of green, with its velvet
      turf and trim slopes, and tall mask of trees, all mellow in the shade of
      the soft September afternoon, listened to him with wondering eyes and pale
      cheeks. It was no longer Jimmie of the homely face that was talking; he
      was transfigured. His very voice had changed its quality.... Did he love
      her? The word was inept in its inadequacy. He worshipped her like a
      Madonna. He adored her like a queen. He loved her as the man of hot blood
      loves a woman. Soul and heart and body clamoured for her. Compared with
      hers, every other woman's beauty was a glow-worm unto lightning. Her voice
      haunted him like music heard in sleep. Her presence left a fragrance
      behind that clouded his senses like incense. Her beauty twined itself into
      every tendril of every woman's hair he painted, stole into the depths of
      every woman's eyes. It was a divine obsession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must fight against it,&rdquo; Connie whispered tonelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I? Who is harmed? Norma? Who will tell her? Not I. If I choose
      to fill my life with her splendour, what is that to any one? The desire of
      the moth for the star! Who heeds the moth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on reckless of speech until his passion had spent itself. Then he
      could only repeat in a broken way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love her? Heaven knows I love her. My soul is a footstool for her to rest
      her feet upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie Deering laid her hand on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmie. God bless you, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised the hand to his lips. Neither spoke. He plucked at the grass by
      his side; at length he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't give me away, will you?&rdquo; he said with a smile, using her
      dialect.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on her knees and clasped both his wrists. She said the first
      thing that came, as something sacred, into her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could no more speak of this to any one than of some of my dead
      husband's kisses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are a good true woman, Connie,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed, Norma, who had come to summon Connie to tea
      (the Spencer-Temples having called on their drive past the gates merely to
      deliver a message), and hearing the voice behind the hedge had been
      compelled against her will to listen&mdash;Norma, deadly white, shaken to
      the roots of her being, crept across the tennis lawn and fled in swaying
      darkness to her room.

      Chapter XIII&mdash;THE OPTIMIST AT LARGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ONNIE DEERING
      walked back to the house with a silent and still tremulous Jimmie. She had
      slid her hand through his arm, and now and then gave it an affectionate
      pat. Within the limitations of her light, gay nature she was a sympathetic
      and loyal woman, and she had loved Jimmie for many years with the
      unquestioning fondness that one has for a beloved and satisfying domestic
      animal. She had recovered from the fright his frantic demonstration had
      caused her, and her easy temperament had shaken off the little chill of
      solemnity that had accompanied her vow of secrecy. But she pitied him with
      all her kind heart, and in herself felt agreeably sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      They strolled slowly into the hall, and paused for a moment before
      parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you come to think of it seriously, you won't consider I have made
      too impossible a fool of myself?&rdquo; he asked with an apologetic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; she said affectionately. Then she laughed. Not only was
      Jimmie's smile contagious, but Connie Deering could not face the pleasant
      world for more than an hour without laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always said you were a dear, Jimmie, and you are. I almost wish I
      could kiss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie looked around. They were quite unperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do quite,&rdquo; he said, and kissed her on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we are really brother and sister,&rdquo; she said with a flush. &ldquo;You are
      not going to be too unhappy, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh no, not I,&rdquo; he replied heartily. He repeated this asseveration to
      himself while dressing for dinner. Why indeed should he be unhappy? Had he
      not looked a few hours before at God's earth and found that it was good?
      Besides, to add to the common stock of the world's unhappiness were a
      crime. &ldquo;Yes, a crime,&rdquo; he said aloud, with a vigorous pull at his white
      tie. Then he perceived that it was hopelessly mangled, and wished for
      Aline, who usually conducted that part of the ceremony of his toilette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will have to do,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, as he turned away from the
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, for all his philosophising, he was surprised at the relief that his
      wild confession to Connie had afforded him. The burden that had seemed too
      heavy for him to bear had now grown magically light. He attributed the
      phenomenon to Connie Deering, to the witchery of her sweet sympathy and
      the comfort of her sisterly kiss. By the time he had finished dressing the
      acute pain of the past two days had vanished, and as he went down the
      stairs he accounted himself a happy man. In the drawing-room he met Norma,
      and chatted to her almost light-heartedly. He did not notice the
      constraint in her manner, her avoidance of his glance, the little pucker
      of troubled brows; nor was he aware of her sigh of relief when the door
      opened and the servant announced Mr. Theodore Weever, who with one or two
      other people were dining at the house. Mr. and Mrs. Hardacre followed on
      the American's heels, and soon the rest of the party had assembled. Jimmie
      had no opportunity for further talk with Norma, who studiously kept apart
      from him all the evening, and during dinner devoted herself to subacid
      conversation with Morland and to a reckless interchange of cynical banter
      with Weever. Jimmie, talking with picturesque fancy about his student days
      in the Rue Bonaparte to his neighbour, a frank fox-hunting and
      sport-loving young woman, never dreamed of the chaos of thoughts and
      feelings that whirled behind the proud face on the opposite side of the
      table; and Norma, when her mind now and then worked lucidly, wondered at
      the strength and sweetness of the man who could subdue such passion and
      laugh with a gaiety so honest and sincere. For herself, Theodore Weever,
      with his icy humour that crystallised her own irony into almost deadly
      wit, was her sole salvation during the interminable meal. Once Morland,
      listening with admiration, whispered in her ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never heard you in such good form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had to choke down an hysterical impulse of laughter and swallow a
      mouthful of champagne. Later, when the women guests had gone, she slipped
      up to her room without saying good-night to Morland, and, dismissing her
      maid, as she had done the night before, sat for a long time, holding her
      head in her hands, vainly seeking to rid it of words that seemed to have
      eaten into her brain. And when she thought of Morland, of last night, of
      her humiliation, she flushed hot from hair to feet. She was only
      five-and-twenty, and the world had not as yet completed its work of
      hardening. It was a treacherous and deceitful world; she had prided
      herself on being a finished product of petrifaction, and here she lay,
      scorched and bewildered, like any soft and foolish girl who had been
      suddenly brought too near the flame of life. Keenly she felt the
      piteousness of her defeat. In what it exactly consisted she did not know.
      She was only conscious of broken pride, the shattering of the little
      hard-faced gods in her temple, the tearing up of the rails upon which she
      had reckoned to travel to her journey's end. Hers was a confused soul
      state, devoid of immediate purpose. A breach of her engagement with
      Morland did not occur to her mind, and Jimmie was merely an impersonal
      utterer of volcanic words. She slept but little. In the morning she found
      habit by her bedside; she clothed herself therein and faced the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much was expected of her. The great garden-party was to take place that
      afternoon. Her Serene Highness the Princess of Herren-Rothbeck had
      signified that she would do Mr. and Mrs. Hardacre the honour of being
      present. Her Grace the Duchess of Wiltshire would accompany the princess.
      The <i>ban</i> and <i>arriere-ban</i> of the county had been invited, and
      the place would be filled with fair women agog to bask in the smiles of
      royalty, and ill-tempered men dragged away from their partridges by
      ambitious wives. A firm of London caterers had contracted for the
      refreshments. A military band would play on the terrace. A clever French
      showman whom Providence had sent to cheer the dying hours of the London
      season, and had kept during the dead months at a variety theatre, was
      coming down with an authentic Guignol. He had promised the choicest pieces
      in his repertoire&mdash;<i>la vraie grivoiserie française</i>&mdash;and
      men who had got wind of the proposed entertainment winked at one another
      wickedly. The garden-party was to be an affair of splendour worthy of the
      royal lady who had deigned to shed her serenity upon the county families
      assembled; and Mr. Hardacre had raised a special sum of money to meet the
      expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to go to the Jews, my dear,&rdquo; he had said to his wife when
      they were first discussing ways and means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go to the&mdash;Jews then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, almost betrayed, in
      her irritation, into an unwifely retort. &ldquo;What does it matter, what does
      any sacrifice matter, when once we have royalty at the house? You are such
      a fool, Benjamin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a singular faculty for arousing the waspishness of his wife; yet,
      save on rare occasions, he was the meekest of men in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know best, Eliza,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n't been married to you for six-and-twenty years without being
      perfectly certain of that,&rdquo; she replied tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Hardacre went to the Jews, and the princess promised to come to
      Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma was not the only one that morning who was aroused to a sense of
      responsibility. The footman entering Jimmie's bedroom brought with him a
      flat cardboard box neatly addressed in Aline's handwriting. The box
      contained a new shirt, two new collars, a new silk tie, and a pair of grey
      suède gloves; also a letter from Aline instructing him as to the use of
      these various articles of attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure to wear your frock-coat,&rdquo; wrote the director of Jimmie's conduct.
      &ldquo;I wish you had one less than six years old; but I went over it with
      benzine and ammonia before I packed it up, so perhaps it won't be so bad.
      And wear your patent-leather evening shoes. They'll look quite smart if
      you'll tie the laces up tight, and stick the ends in between the shoe and
      the sock. Oh, I wish I could come and turn you out decently! and <i>please</i>,
      Jimmie dear, don't cut yourself shaving and go about all day with a
      ridiculous bit of cotton wool on your dear chin. Tony says you need n't
      wear the frock-coat, but I know better. What acquaintance has he with
      princesses and duchesses? And that reminds me to tell you that Tony&mdash;&rdquo;
       <i>et caetera, et caetera,</i> in a manner that brought the kindest smile
      in the world into Jimmie's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed with scrupulous regard to directions, but not in the
      frock-coat. He had a morning sitting with the princess at Chiltern Towers
      to get through before airing himself in the splendour of benzine and
      ammonia. He put on his old tweed jacket and went downstairs. Morland was
      the only person as yet in the breakfast-room. He held a morning paper
      tight in his hand, and stared through the window, his back to the door. On
      Jimmie's entrance he started round, and Jimmie saw by a harassed face that
      something had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow&mdash;&rdquo; he began in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland smoothed out the paper with nervous fingers, and threw it somewhat
      ostentatiously on a chair. Then he walked to the table and poured himself
      out some tea. The handle of the silver teapot slid in his grasp, and
      awkwardly trying to save the pouring flood of liquid, he dropped the
      teapot among the cups and saucers. It was a disaster, but one that could
      have been adequately greeted by a simpler series of expletives. He cursed
      vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, man?&rdquo; asked Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland turned violently upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very devil's the matter. There never was such a mess since the world
      began. What an infernal fool I have been! You do well to steer clear of
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what's wrong and I may be able to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland looked at him for a moment in gloomy doubt. Then he shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't help me. I thought you could, but you can't. It's a matter for
      a lawyer. I must run up to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cut the garden-party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where I'm tied,&rdquo; exclaimed Morland, impatiently. &ldquo;I ought to start
      now, but if I cut the garden-party the duchess would never forgive me&mdash;and
      by Jove, I may need the duchess more than ever&mdash;and I've got a
      meeting to attend in Cosford this morning to which a lot of people are
      coming from a distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't I interview the lawyer for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I must do it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler entered and looked with grave displeasure at the wreckage on
      the tea-tray. While he was repairing the disaster, Morland went back to
      the window and Jimmie stood by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you fight it through squarely, it will all come right in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mind my not telling you about it?&rdquo; said Morland, in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I? In everything there is a time for silence and a time for
      speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; said Morland, thrusting his hands into his trousers'
      pockets; &ldquo;but how I am to get through this accursed day in silence I don't
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down to breakfast. Morland rejected the offer of tea, and called
      for a whisky and soda which he nearly drained at a gulp. Mr. Hardacre came
      in, and eyed the long glass indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bucking yourself up, eh? Why did n't you ask for a pint of champagne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the newspaper and ran through the pages. Morland watched him
      with swift nervous glances, and uttered a little gasp of relief when he
      threw it aside and attacked his grilled kidneys. His own meal was soon
      over. Explaining that he had papers to work at in the library, he hurried
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't understand a man being so keen on these confounded politics,&rdquo; his
      host remarked to Jimmie across the table. A polite commonplace was all
      that could be expected in reply. Politics were engrossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the worst of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Hardacre. &ldquo;In the good old days a man
      could take his politics like a gentleman; now he has got to go at them
      like a damned blaspheming agitator on a tub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cosford was once a pretty little pocket borough, wasn't it?&rdquo; said Jimmie.
      &ldquo;Now Trade's unfeeling train usurp the privileges of His Grace of
      Wiltshire and threaten to dispossess his nominee. Instead of one simple
      shepherd recording his pastoral vote we have an educated electorate daring
      to exercise their discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardacre looked at Jimmie askance; he always regarded an allusive
      style with suspicion, as if it necessarily harboured revolutionary
      theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you're not one of those&mdash;&rdquo; He checked himself as he was going
      to say &ldquo;low radical fellows.&rdquo; Politeness forbade. &ldquo;I hope you are not a
      radical, Mr. Padgate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I don't quite know,&rdquo; replied Jimmie, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Mr. Hardacre, &ldquo;I believe you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie laughed; but Mr. Hardacre felt that he held the key to the
      eccentric talk of his guest. Jimmie Padgate was a radical; a fearful
      wildfowl of unutterable proclivities, to whom all things dreadful were
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;am proud to be a Tory of the old school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of the ladies put a stop to the distressful conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie, whose life during the past few days had been a curious compound of
      sunshine and shadow, went about his morning's work with only Morland's
      troubles weighing upon him. Of their specific nature he had no notion; he
      knew they had to do with the unhappy love affair; but as Morland was going
      to put matters into the hands of his lawyers, a satisfactory solution was
      bound to be discovered. Like all simple-minded men, he had illimitable
      faith in the powers of solicitors and physicians; it was their business to
      get people out of difficulties, and if they were capable men they did
      their business. Deriving much comfort from this fallacy, he thought as
      little as might be about the matter. In fact he quite enjoyed his morning.
      He sat before his easel at the end of a high historic gallery, the bright
      morning light that streamed in through the windows tempered by judiciously
      arranged white blinds; and down the vista were great paintings, and rare
      onyx tables, and priceless chairs and statuary, all harmonising with the
      stately windows and painted ceiling and polished floor. In front of him,
      posed in befitting attitude, sat the royal lady, with her most urbane
      expression upon her features, and, that which pleased him most, the
      picture was just emerging from the blurred mass of paint, an excellent
      though somewhat idealised portrait. So he worked unfalteringly with the
      artist's joy in the consciousness of successful efforts, and his
      good-humour infected even his harsh sitter, who now and then showed a
      wintry gleam of gaiety, and uttered a guttural word of approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall come to Herren-Rothbeck and baint the bortrait of the brince my
      brother,&rdquo; she said graciously. &ldquo;Would that blease you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should just think it would,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess laughed&mdash;a creaking, rusty laugh, but thoroughly well
      intentioned. Jimmie glanced at her enquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;You are so natural&mdash;what you English
      call refreshing. A German would have made a ceremonious speech as long as
      your mahl-stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I must learn ceremony before I come to court, Madam,&rdquo; said
      Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, you will have forgotten how to baint bor-traits,&rdquo; said the
      princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, under the sun of princely favour, was Jimmie proceeding on the
      highroad to fortune. Never had the future seemed so bright. His bombastic
      jest about being appointed painter in ordinary to the crowned heads of
      Europe was actually going to turn out a reality. He lost himself in
      daydreams of inexhaustible coffers from which he could toss gold in
      lapfuls to Aline. She should indeed walk in silk attire, and set up
      housekeeping with Tony in a mansion in Park Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the front lawn at Heddon Court he met Connie and waved his hat in the
      air. She went to him, and, peering into his smiling face, laid her hand
      on his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever has happened? Have you two stepped into each other's shoes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know&mdash;Norma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Connie&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seemed natural. Here are you as happy as an emperor; and there
      is Morland come back from Cosford with the look of a hunted criminal.&rdquo;

      Chapter XIV&mdash;THE BUBBLE REPUTATION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE princess had
      the affability to inform Mrs. Hardacre that it was a &ldquo;charming barty,&rdquo; and
      Mrs. Hardacre felt that she had not lived in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth she would be of the innermost circle of the elect of the
      county. Exclusive front doors would open respectfully to her. She would be
      consulted on matters appertaining to social polity. She would be a
      personage. She would also make her neighbour, Lady FitzHubert, sick with
      envy. A malignant greenness on that lady's face she noted with a thrill of
      pure happiness, and she smilingly frustrated all her manoeuvres to get
      presented to Her Serene Highness. She presented her rival, instead, to
      Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lady FitzHubert, let me introduce Mr. Padgate, who is painting
      the dear princess's portrait. Mr. Padgate is staying with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereby Mrs. Hardacre conveyed the impression that Heddon Court and
      Chiltern Towers contained just one family party, the members of which ran
      in and out of either house indiscriminately. It may be mentioned that
      Jimmie did not get on particularly well with Lady FitzHubert. He even
      confided afterwards to Connie Deering his suspicion that now and again
      members of the aristocracy were lacking in true urbanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      By declaring the garden-party to be charming the princess only did justice
      to the combined efforts of the Hardacres and Providence. The warm golden
      weather and the chance of meeting august personages had brought guests
      from far and near. The lawns were bright with colour and resonant with
      talk. A red-coated band played on the terrace. Between the items of music,
      Guignol, housed in the Greek temple, with the portico for a proscenium,
      performed his rogueries to the delight of hastily assembling audiences.
      Immediately below, a long white-covered table gleamed with silver tea-urns
      and china, and all the paraphernalia of refreshments. At the other end of
      the lawn sat the august personages surrounded by the elect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these was Morland. But for him neither blue September skies nor
      amiable duchesses had any charm. To the man of easy living had come the
      sudden shock of tragedy, and the music and the teacups and the flatteries
      seemed parts of a ghastly farce. The paragraph he had read in the paper
      that morning obsessed him. The hours had seemed one long shudder against
      which he vainly braced his nerves. He had loved the poor girl in his
      facile way. The news in itself was enough to bring him face to face with
      elementals. But there was another terror added. The chance word of a
      laughing woman had put him on the rack of anxiety. Getting out of the
      train at Cosford, she had seen the queerest figure of a man step on to the
      platform, with the face of Peter the Hermit and the costume of Mr.
      Stiggins. Morland's first impulse had been to retreat precipitately from
      Cosford, and take the next train to London, whither he ought to have gone
      that morning. The tradition-bred Englishman's distaste for craven flight
      kept him irresolutely hanging round the duchess. He thought of whispering
      a private word to Jimmie; but Jimmie was far away, being introduced here
      and there, apparently enjoying considerable popularity. Besides, the
      whisper would involve the tale of the newspaper paragraph, and Morland
      shrank from confiding such news to Jimmie. No one on earth must know it
      save his legal adviser, an impersonal instrument of protection. He did
      what he had done once during five horrible weeks at Oxford, when an
      Abingdon barmaid threatened him with a breach of promise action. He did
      nothing and trusted to luck. Happy chance brought to light the fact that
      she was already married. Happy chance might save him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the mere commonplaces of civility he had exchanged no words that
      day with Norma. Moved by an irritating feeling of shame coupled with a
      certain repugnance of the flesh, he had deliberately avoided her; and his
      preoccupation had not allowed him to perceive that the avoidance was
      reciprocated. When they happened to meet in their movements among the
      guests, they smiled at each other mechanically and went their respective
      ways. Once, during the afternoon, Mr. Hardacre, red and fussy, took him
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just heard a couple of infernal old cats talking of Norma and that
      fellow Weever. There they are together now. Will you give Norma a hint, or
      shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland looked up and saw the pair on the terrace, midway between the band
      and the Guignol audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad she has got somebody to amuse her,&rdquo; he said, turning away. He
      was almost grateful to Weever for taking Norma off his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Jimmie was continuing to find life full of agreeable surprises.
      Lady FitzHubert was not the only lady to whom he was presented as the Mr.
      Padgate who was painting the princess's portrait. Mrs. Hardacre waived the
      personal grudge, and flourished him tactfully in the face of the county;
      and the county accepted him with unquestioning ingenuousness. He was
      pointed out as a notability, became the well-known portrait-painter, the
      celebrated artist, <i>the</i> James Padgate, and thus achieved the bubble
      reputation. A guest who was surreptitiously reporting the garden-party for
      the local paper took eager notes of the personal appearance of the eminent
      man, and being a woman of the world, professed familiarity with his works.
      For the first time in his life he found himself a person of importance.
      The fact of his easy inclusion in the charmed circle cast a glamour over
      the crudities of the gala costume designed and furbished up with so much
      anxious thought by Aline, and people (who are kindly as a rule when their
      attention is diverted from the trivial) looked only at his face and were
      attracted to the man himself. Only Lady FitzHubert, who had private
      reasons for frigidity, treated him in an unbecoming manner. Other fair
      ladies smiled sweetly upon him, and spread abroad tales of his niceness,
      and thus helped in the launching of him as a fashionable portrait-painter
      upon the gay world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a brief interlude of talk with Norma by the refreshment-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not being too much bored by all this,&rdquo; she said in her
      society manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bored!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It's delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the hollow world where imagination doth not corrupt and
      enthusiasms do not break in and steal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a phantom dust-heap for inept epigrams. I don't believe it exists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't preach a gospel one day and give it the lie the next,&rdquo; she
      said, half seriously; &ldquo;for then I won't know what to believe. You don't
      seem to realise your responsibilities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He echoed the last word in some surprise. Norma broke into a little
      nervous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't suppose you can go about without affecting your
      fellow-creatures? It is well that you don't know what a disturbing element
      you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head away and closed her eyes for a second or two, for the
      words she had overheard there by the hedge, last evening, rang in her
      ears. Perhaps it had been well for Jimmie if he had known. Before he had
      time to reply, she recovered herself, and added quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you are enjoying yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it when every one is so kind to me?&rdquo; he said brightly. &ldquo;I
      came down here an obscure painter, a veritable <i>pictor ignotus</i>, and
      all your friends are as charming to me as if I were the President of the
      Royal Academy.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
Connie Deering came up with a message for Norma and
      carried her off to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does Jimmie like being lionised?&rdquo; she asked on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma repeated his last speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has n't any idea of the people's motives.&rdquo; She added somewhat
      hysterically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is half fool, half angel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And altogether a <i>man</i>. Don't you make any mistake about that,&rdquo; said
      Connie, with a pretty air of finality. &ldquo;You don't know as much about him
      as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so sure about that,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie was wandering away from the refreshment-table when Theodore Weever
      stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a famous portrait of yours, Mr. Padgate. I saw it to-day after
      lunch. I offer you my congratulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie thanked him, said modestly that he hoped it was a good likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too good by a long chalk,&rdquo; laughed the American. &ldquo;Her Serene Skinflint
      does n't deserve it. I bet you she beat you down like a market-woman
      haggling for fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie stuck his hands on his hips and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't deny it. You should n't have let her. She is rolling in money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid one does n't bother much with the commercial side of things,&rdquo;
       said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where you make the mistake. Money is money, and it is better in
      one's own pockets than in anybody else's. But that's not what I wanted to
      speak to you about. I wonder if you would let me have the pleasure of
      calling at your studio some day? I'm collecting a few pictures, and I
      should regard it as a privilege to be allowed to look round yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie, having no visiting cards, scribbled his address on the back of an
      envelope. He would be delighted to see Mr. Weever any time he was passing
      through London. Weever bowed, and turned to greet a passing acquaintance,
      leaving a happy artist. A miracle had happened; the star of his fortunes
      had arisen. A week ago it was below the horizon, shedding a faint, hopeful
      glimmer in the sky. Now it shone bright overhead. The days of struggle and
      disappointment were over. He had come into his kingdom of recognition. All
      had happened to-day: the princess's promise of another and more
      illustrious royal portrait; the sudden leap into fame; the patronage of
      the American financier. One has to be the poor artist, with his youth&mdash;one record of desperate endeavour&mdash;behind him, to know what these
      things mean. The delicate flattery of strange women, however commonplace
      or contemptible it may be to the successful, was a new, rare thing to
      Jimmie and appeased an unknown hunger. The prospect of good work done and
      delivered to the world, without sordid, heart-breaking bargainings,
      shimmered before him like a paradise. Old habit made him long for Aline.
      How pleased the child would be when she heard the glad news! He saw the
      joy on her bright face and heard her clap her hands together, and he
      smiled. He would return to her a conqueror, having won the prizes she had
      so often wept for&mdash;name and fame and fortune. The band was playing
      the &ldquo;Wedding March&rdquo; from &ldquo;Lohengrin.&rdquo; By chance, as he was no musician, he
      recognised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aline shall have a wedding dress from Paris,&rdquo; he said half aloud, and he
      smiled again. The world had never been so beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He embraced all of it that was visible in a happy, sweeping glance. Then
      with the swiftness of lightning the smile on his face changed into
      consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood stock still, staring at the sudden figure of a man.
      It was Stone, the mad orator of Hyde Park. There was no possibility of
      mistaking him at a distance of fifteen or twenty yards. He wore the same
      rusty black frock-coat and trousers, the same dirty collar and narrow
      black tie, the same shapeless clerical hat. His long neck above the collar
      looked raw and scabious like a vulture's. In his hand he carried a folded
      newspaper. He had suddenly emerged upon the end of the terrace from the
      front entrance, and was descending the steps that led down to the tennis
      lawn. If he walked straight on, he would come to the group surrounding the
      princess and the Duchess of Wiltshire. Two or three people were already
      eyeing him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland's strange dread of the man flashed upon Jimmie. He hurried forward
      to meet him. Of what he was about to do he had no definite idea. Perhaps
      he could head Stone off, take him away from the grounds on the pretext of
      listening to his grievances. At any rate, a scandal must be avoided. As he
      drew near, he observed Morland, who had been bending down in conversation
      with the duchess, rise and unexpectedly recognise Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A manservant bearing a small tray with some teacups ran up to the
      extraordinary intruder, who waved him away impatiently. The servant put
      down his tray and caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no business here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone shook himself free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. Where is Mr. Rendell? Tell him I have to speak with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no such person here,&rdquo; said the servant. &ldquo;Be off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie reached the spot, as a few of the nearer guests were beginning to
      take a surprised interest in the altercation. Morland came forward from
      behind the duchess's chair and cast a swift glance at Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't go, I shall make you,&rdquo; said the servant, preparing to
      execute his threat. The man looked dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see Mr. David Rendell,&rdquo; he cried, beginning to struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie drew the servant away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know this gentleman,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Mr. Stone, Mr. Rendell is not
      here, but if you will come with me, I will listen to you, and tell him
      anything you have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardacre, who had seen the scuffle from a distance, came up in a
      fluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this? What's all this? Who is this creature? Please go away.&rdquo;
       He began to hustle the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! He's an acquaintance of Padgate's,&rdquo; said Morland, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause. Stone stared around at the well-dressed men and
      women, at the seated figures of the princess and the duchess, at the
      servant who had picked up the tray, at the band who were still playing the
      &ldquo;Wedding March&rdquo; from &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; at the red-faced, little, blustering
      man, at the beautiful cool setting of green, and the look in his eyes was
      that of one who saw none of these things. Morland edged to Jimmie's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, get him away,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie nodded and touched the man's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, please take him off! What the dickens does he want?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone turned his burning eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to find an infamous seducer,&rdquo; he replied, with a melodramatic
      intensity that would have been ludicrous had his face not been so ghastly.
      &ldquo;His name is Rendell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a shiver of interest in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Was sagt er?</i>&rdquo; the princess whispered to her neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie again tried to lead Stone away, but the distraught creature seemed
      lost in thought and looked at him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen you before,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;In Hyde Park. Don't you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with a wrench of his hands he tore an unmounted photograph from
      the folded newspaper and threw it on the ground. His eyes blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I should find him. One of you is David Rendell. It is not your
      real name. That I know. Which of you is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie had sprung upon the photograph. Instinct rather than the evidence
      of sight told him that it was an amateur portrait of himself and Morland
      taken one idle afternoon in the studio by young Tony Merewether. It had
      hardly lain the fraction of a second on the ground but to Jimmie it seemed
      as if the two figures had flashed clear upon the sight of all the
      bystanders. He glanced quickly at Morland, who stood quite still now with
      stony face and averted eyes. He too had recognised the photograph, and he
      cursed himself for a fool for having given it to the girl. He had had it
      loose in his pocket; she had pleaded for it; she had no likeness of him at
      all. He was paying now for his imprudent folly. Like Jimmie, he feared
      lest others should have recognised the photograph. But he trusted again to
      chance. Jimmie had undertaken the unpleasant business and his wit would
      possibly save the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie did not hesitate. A man is as God made him, heart and brain. To his
      impulsive imagination the photograph would be proof positive for the world
      that one of the two was the infamous seducer. It did not occur to him to
      brazen the man out, to send him about his business; wherein lies the
      pathos of simple-mindedness. The decisive moment had come. To Morland
      exposure would mean loss of career, and, as he conceived it, loss of
      Norma; and to the beloved woman it would mean misery and heartbreak. So he
      committed an heroic folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i> Rendell,&rdquo; he said in a loud voice. &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heedless of shocked whisperings and confused voices, among which rose a
      virtuously indignant &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; from Mrs. Hardacre, he moved away
      quickly towards the slope, motioning Stone to follow. But Stone remained
      where he stood, and pointed at Jimmie with lean, outstretched finger, and
      lifted up his voice in crazy rhetoric, which was heard above the &ldquo;Wedding
      March.&rdquo; No one tried to stop him. It was too odd, too interesting, too
      dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world shall know the tale of your lust, and the sun shall not go down
      upon your iniquity. Under false promises you betrayed the sweetest flower
      in God's garden. Basely you taunted her in her hour of need. Murder and
      suicide are on your head. There is the record for all who wish to read it.
      Read it,&rdquo; he cried, flinging the newspaper at Mrs. Hardacre's feet. &ldquo;Read
      how she killed her newborn babe, the child of this devil, and then hanged
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie came two or three steps forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop this mad foolery,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone glared at him for a fraction of a second, thrust his hand into the
      breast-pocket of his frock-coat, drew out a revolver, and shot him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie staggered as a streak of fire passed through him, and swung round.
      The women shrieked and rushed together behind the princess and the
      duchess, who remained calmly seated. The men with one impulse sprang
      forward to seize the madman; but as he leaped aside and threatened his
      assailants with his revolver, they hung back. The band stopped short in
      the middle of a bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma and Connie Deering and one or two others who had been in the house,
      unaware of the commotion of the last few minutes, ran out on the terrace
      as they heard the shot and the sudden cessation of the band. They saw the
      crowd of frightened, nervous people below, and the grotesque figure in his
      rusty black pointing the pistol. And they saw Jimmie march up to him, and
      in a dead silence they heard him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that revolver. What is a silly fool like you doing with
      fire-arms? You could n't hit a haystack at a yard's distance. Give it to
      me, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man's arm was outstretched, and the pistol was aimed point-blank at
      Jimmie. Connie Deering gripped Norma's arm, and Norma, feeling faint, grew
      white to the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said Jimmie again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man wavered, his arm drooped slightly; with the action of one who
      takes a dangerous thing from a child, Jimmie quietly wrenched the revolver
      from his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma gave a gasp of relief and began to laugh foolishly. Connie clapped
      her hands in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n't I tell you he was a man? By heavens, the only one in the lot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie pointed towards the terrace steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a rush now to seize the disarmed Stone, the red coats of the
      bandsmen mingling with the black of the guests. Jimmie, with a curious
      flame through his shoulder and a swimming in his head, swerved aside.
      Morland ran up, with a white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! He has hit you. I thought he had missed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jimmie, smiling at the reeling scene. &ldquo;I'm all right. Keep the
      photograph. It was silly to give one's photograph away. I always was a
      fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland pocketed the unmounted print. He tried to utter a word of thanks,
      but the eyes of the scared and scandalised crowd a few steps away were
      upon them, and many were listening. For a moment during the madman's crazy
      indictment of Jimmie&mdash;for the horrible facts were only too true&mdash;he
      had had the generous impulse to come forward and at all costs save his
      friend; but he had hesitated. The shot had been fired. The dramatic little
      scene had followed. To proclaim Jimmie's innocence and his own guilt now
      would be an anticlimax. It was too late. He would take another opportunity
      of exonerating Jimmie. So he stood helpless before him, and Jimmie,
      feeling fainter and fainter, protested that he was not hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood a bit apart from the rest. By this time men and women had
      flocked from all quarters, and practically the whole party had assembled
      on the tennis lawn. Norma still stood with Connie on the terrace, her hand
      on her heart. A small group clustered round a man who had picked up the
      newspaper and was reading aloud the ghastly paragraph marked by Stone in
      blue pencil. The Hardacres were wringing their hands before a stony-faced
      princess and an indignant duchess, who announced their intention of
      immediate departure. Every one told every one else the facts he or she had
      managed to gather. Human nature and the morbidly stimulated imagination of
      naturally unimaginative people invented atrocious details. Jimmie's
      new-born fame as a painter was quickly merged into hideous notoriety. His
      star must have been Lucifer, so swift was its fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardacre left his wife's side, and dragged Morland a step or two away,
      and whispered excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a scandal! What a hell of a scandal! Before royalty, too. It will be
      the death of us. The damned fellow must go. You must clear him out of the
      house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's hit. Look at him,&rdquo; exclaimed Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie heard his host's whisper in a dream. It seemed a hoarse voice very,
      very far off. He laughed in an idiotic way, waved his hand to the gyrating
      crowd, and stumbled a few yards towards the slope. The world swam into
      darkness and he fell heavily on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, to the amazement of the county, Norma with a ringing cry rushed down
      the slope, and threw herself beside Jimmie's body and put his head on her
      lap. And there she stayed until they dragged her away, uttering the queer
      whimpering exclamations of a woman suddenly stricken with great terror.
      She thought Jimmie was dead.

    <h2>
      Chapter XV&mdash;MRS. HARDACRE LAUGHS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HEY took Jimmie
      into the house, and Norma, looking neither to right nor left, walked by
      the side of those carrying him, the front of her embroidered dress smeared
      with blood. Every time her hands came in contact with the delicate fabric,
      they left a fresh smear. Of this she was unconscious. She was unconscious
      too, save in a dull way, of the staring crowd; but she held her head high,
      and when Morland spoke to her by the drawing-room window through which
      they passed, she listened to what he had to say, bowed slightly, and went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only a flesh wound. If it had been the lung, he would have spat
      blood. I don't think it is serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a curiously apologetic tone, as if anxious to exculpate
      himself from complicity in the attempted murder.. He was horribly
      frightened. Two deaths laid in one day at a man's door are enough. The
      possibility of a third was intolerable. The sense of the unheroic part he
      had just played was beginning to creep over him like a chilling mist. The
      consequences of confession, the only means whereby Jimmie could be
      rehabilitated, loomed in front of him more and more disastrous. It would
      be presenting himself to the world as a coward as well as a knave. That
      prospect, too, frightened him. Lastly, there was Norma, white,
      terror-stricken, metamorphosed in a second into a creature of primitive
      emotions. Like the other shocks of that unhallowed day, her revelation of
      unsuspected passions brought him face to face with the unfamiliar; and to
      the average sensual man the unfamiliar brings with it an atmosphere of the
      uncanny, the influence to be feared. His attitude, therefore, when he
      addressed her was ludicrously humble.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed and passed on. By this time she knew that Jimmie was not dead.
      Morland's words even reassured her. Her breath came hard through her
      delicate nostrils, and her bosom heaved up and down beneath the open-work
      bodice with painful quickness. Only a few were allowed to stay in the
      dining-room, Morland, Mr. Hardacre, Theodore Weever on behalf of the
      duchess, and one or two others, while the Cosford doctor, who had been
      invited to the garden-party, made his examination. Norma went through into
      the hall. At the bottom of the stairs she met Connie in piteous distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my poor dear, my poor dear, we did n't know! I have just heard all
      about it. It is terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma put up her hand beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, Connie dear; don't talk of it. I can't bear it. I must be alone.
      Send me up word what the doctor says.&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
She went to her room, sat there and
      waited. Presently her maid entered with the message from Mrs. Deering. The
      doctor's report was favourable&mdash;the wound not in any way dangerous,
      the bullet easily extractable. They had carried the patient to his
      bedroom, and Mrs. Deering had wired for Miss Marden to come down by the
      first train. Norma dismissed the maid, and tried, in a miserable wonder,
      to realise all that had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman accustomed to many emotions can almost always hold herself in
      check, if she be of strong will. Experience has taught her the meaning and
      the danger of those swift rushes of the blood that lead to unreasoning
      outburst. She is forewarned, forearmed, and can resist or not as occasion
      demands. But even she is sometimes taken unawares. How much the more
      likely to give way is the woman who has never felt passionate emotion in
      her life before. The premonitory symptoms fail to convey the sense of
      danger to her inexperienced mind. Before the will has time to act she is
      swept on by a new force, bewildering, irresistible. It becomes an ecstatic
      madness of joy or grief, and to the otherwise rational being her actions
      are of no account. This curse of quick responsiveness afflicts men to a
      less degree. If the first chapters of Genesis could be brought up to date,
      woman would be endowed, not with an extra rib, but with an extra nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that she knew the shooting of Jimmie to be an affair of no great
      seriousness, her heart sickened at the thought of her wild exhibition of
      feeling. She heard the sniggering and ridicule in every carriage-load of
      homeward-bound guests. From the wife of the scrubby curate to the Princess
      of Herren-Rothbeck, her name was rolled like a delicate morsel on the
      tongue of every woman in the county. And the inference they could not fail
      to draw from her action was true&mdash;miserably true. But she had only
      become poignantly aware of things at the moment when she saw the lean
      haggard man in rusty black covering Jimmie with the revolver. Then all the
      unrest of soul which she had striven to allay with her mockery, all the
      disquieting visions of sweet places to which she had scornfully blinded
      her eyes, all the burning words of passion whose clear echoing had wrapped
      her body in hateful fever the night before, converged like electric
      currents into one steady light radiant with significance. Two minutes
      afterwards, when Jimmie fell, civilisation slipped from her like a loose
      garment, and primitive woman threw herself by his side. But now,
      reclothed, she shivered at the memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened suddenly, and Mrs. Hardacre entered. There was battle in
      every line of the hard face and in every movement of the thin, stiff
      figure. Norma rose from the window where she had been sitting and faced
      her mother defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you are going to say to me. Don't you think you might wait a
      little? It will keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't. Sit down,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to stand for the moment,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre lost her self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we to send you to a madhouse? What do you mean by your blazing folly?
      Before the whole county&mdash;before the duchess&mdash;before the
      princess! Do you know what I have had to go through the last half-hour? Do
      you know that we may never set foot in Chiltern Towers again? Do you know
      we are the scandal and the laughing-stock of the county? As if one thing
      was n't sufficient&mdash;for you to crown it by behaving like a hysterical
      school-girl! Do you know what interpretation every scandal-mongering tabby
      in the place is putting on your insane conduct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Norma, looking at her mother stonily; &ldquo;and for once in
      their spiteful lives they are quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think my meaning is obvious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man&mdash;that painter man dressed like a secondhand clothes-dealer&mdash;that&mdash;that
      beast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre could scarcely trust her senses. The true solution of her
      daughter's extraordinary behaviour had never crossed her most desperate
      imaginings. But then she had not had much time for quiet speculatien. The
      speeding of her hurriedly departing guests had usurped all the wits of the
      poor lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have indeed given us a dramatic entertainment, dear Mrs. Hardacre,&rdquo;
       Lady FitzHubert had said with a sympathetic smile. &ldquo;And poor Norma has
      supplied the curtain. I hope she won't take it too much to heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Hardacre, livid with rage, had had no weapon wherewith to strike
      her adversary who thus took triumphant vengeance. It had been a half-hour
      of grievous humiliation. The fount and origin thereof was lying
      unconscious with a bullet through his shoulder. The subsidiary stream, so
      to speak, was in her room safe and sound. Human nature, for which she is
      not deserving of over-blame, had driven Mrs. Hardacre thither. At least
      she could vent some of her pent-up fury upon her outrageous daughter, who,
      from Mrs. Hardacre's point of view, indeed owed an explanation of her
      action and deserved maternal censure. This she was more than prepared to
      administer. But when she heard Norma calmly say that Lady FitzHubert and
      the other delighted wreakers of private revenges were entirely in the
      right, she gasped with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That beast!&rdquo; she repeated with a rising intonation. Norma gave her
      habitual shrug of the shoulders. With her proud, erect bearing, it was a
      gesture not ungraceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering what I have just admitted, mother, perhaps it would be in
      better taste not to use such language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand your admitting it. I don't know what on earth you
      mean,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause, during which she scanned her daughter's face
      anxiously as if waiting to see a gleam of reason dawn on it. Norma
      reflected for a moment. Should she speak or not? She decided to speak.
      Brutal frankness had ever been her best weapon against her mother. It
      would probably prevent future wrangling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I have n't made my meaning clear,&rdquo; she said, resuming her seat
      by the window; &ldquo;and I don't know whether I can make it much clearer.
      Anyhow, I'll try, mother. I used to think that love was either a
      school-girl sentimentality, a fiction of the poets, or else the sort of
      thing that lands married women who don't know how to take care of
      themselves in the divorce court. I find it is n't. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre ran up to the window and faced Norma. &ldquo;And Morland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't break his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What won't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The breaking off of our engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre looked at her daughter in a paralysis of bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The madhouse is the only place for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is. Anyway I can't marry a man when I care for his intimate
      friend&mdash;and when the intimate friend cares for me. Somehow it's not
      quite decent. Even you, mother, can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you and the intimate friend have arranged it all between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. He does n't know that I care, and he does n't know that I know
      that he cares. I'll say that over again if you like. It is quite
      accurately expressed. And you know I'm not in the habit of lying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you propose to marry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't propose to do anything,&rdquo; interrupted Norma, quickly. &ldquo;I at least
      can wait till he asks me. And now, mother, I've had rather a bad time&mdash;don't
      you think we might stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, my dear Norma, we are only just beginning,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma rose with nervous impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O heavens, mother,&rdquo; she said, in the full deep notes of her voice, which
      were only sounded at rare moments of feeling, &ldquo;can't you see that I'm in
      earnest? This man is like no one else I have ever met. I have grown to
      need him. Do you know what that means? With him I am a changed woman&mdash;as
      God made me, I suppose; natural, fresh, real&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Hardacre sat in
      Norma's vacated chair by the window and stared at her, as she moved about
      the room. &ldquo;I somehow feel that I am a woman, after all. I have got
      something higher than myself that I can fall at the feet of, and that's
      what every woman craves when she's decent. As for marrying him&mdash;I'm
      not fit to marry him. There is n't any one living who is. That's an end of
      it, mother. I can't say anything more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you propose to go on seeing this person when he recovers?&rdquo; asked
      Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really can't argue with you,&rdquo; said her mother, mystified. &ldquo;If you had
      told me this rubbish yesterday, I should have thought you touched in your
      wits. To-day it is midsummer madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why to-day?&rdquo; asked Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man has shown himself to be such a horrible beast. Of course, if you
      think confessing to having seduced a girl under infamous circumstances and
      driven her by his brutality to child-murder and suicide, and blazoning the
      whole thing out at a fashionable garden-party and getting himself shot for
      his pains, are idyllic virtues, nothing more can be said. It's a case, as
      I remarked, for a madhouse.&rdquo; Norma came and stood before her mother, her
      brows knitted in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am going crazy&mdash;I really don't understand what you are
      talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre leant forward in her chair and drew a long breath. A gleam
      of intelligence came into her eyes as she looked at Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you don't know what the row was about before the man
      fired the shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Norma, blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother fell back in her chair and laughed. It was the first moment of
      enjoyment she had experienced since Stone's black figure had appeared on
      the terrace. Reaction from strain caused the laughter to ring somewhat
      sharply. Norma regarded her with an anxious frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell me exactly what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child&mdash;it's too funny. I thought you would have been too
      clever to be taken in by a man like this. I see, you've been imagining him
      a Galahad&mdash;a sort of spotless prophet&mdash;though what use you can
      have for such persons I can't make out. Well, this is what happened.&rdquo;
       Embellishing the story here and there with little spiteful adornments, she
      described with fair accuracy, however, the scene that had occurred. Norma
      listened stonily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is true?&rdquo; she asked when her mother had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask any one who was there&mdash;your father&mdash;Morland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't believe it. He is not that sort of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is n't he? I knew he was the first time I set eyes on him. Perhaps
      another time you'll allow me to have some sense&mdash;of course, if it is
      immaterial to you whether a man is a brute&mdash;What are you ringing the
      bell for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to ask Morland to come up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid appeared, received Norma's message, and retired. Norma sat by her
      little writing-table, with her head turned away from her mother, and there
      was silence between them till the maid returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. King has just driven off to catch the train, miss. He left a note for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre listened with contracted brow. When the maid retired, she
      bent forward anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can read it, mother,&rdquo; replied Norma, wearily. She held out the note.
      Mrs. Hardacre came forward and took it from her hand and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Dear Norma,&mdash;I think it best to run up to town on this
      afternoon's business. I have only just time to catch the train at Cosford,
      so you will forgive my not saying good-bye to you more ceremoniously. Take
      care of poor Jimmie.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Yours affectionately,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Morland.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jimmie, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, somewhat relieved at finding
      the note contained no reference to the part played by Norma. &ldquo;It's very
      good of Morland, but I wish he would not mix himself up in this scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see what less he could do than look after his friend's
      interests,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the man had been shot or hanged before he came down here,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Hardacre, vindictively. &ldquo;That's the worst of associating with such
      riff-raff. One never knows what they will do. It will teach you not to
      pick people out of the gutter and set them in a drawing-room.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Hardacre rose. She did not often have the opportunity of triumphing over
      her daughter. She crossed the room and paused for a moment by Norma, who
      sat motionless with her chin in her hand, apparently too dismayed to
      retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see symptoms of sanity,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma brought down her hand hard upon the table and leaped to her feet and
      faced her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, it's impossible! Impossible! He is not that kind of man. It
      is some horrible mistake. I will ask him myself. I will get the truth from
      his own lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall certainly do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; cried her mother; and in
      order to have the last word she went out and slammed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma sat by the window again. The red September sun was setting, and
      bathed downs and trees in warm light, and glinted on the spire of a little
      village church a mile away. Everything it touched was at peace, save the
      bowed head of the girl, clasped with white fingers which still retained
      the dull brown marks of blood. Could she believe the revolting story? A
      woman so driven to desperation must have been cruelly handled. Her sex
      rose up against the destroyer. Her social training had caused her to
      regard with cynical indifference ordinary breaches of what is popularly
      termed the moral law. In the fast, idle set which she generally frequented
      it was as ordinary for a man to neigh after his neighbour's wife as to try
      to win his friend's money; as unsurprising for him to keep a mistress as a
      stud of race-horses; the crime was to marry her. But it was not customary,
      even in smart society, to drive women to murder their new-born babes and
      kill themselves. A callous brutality suggested itself, and the
      contemplation of it touched humanity, sex, essential things. Could she
      believe the story? She shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dressing-gong sounded through the house. Her maid entered, drew the
      curtains, and lit the gas; then was dismissed. Norma would not go down to
      dinner. A little food and drink in her own room would be all that she
      could swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, Connie Deering, who had changed her dress, tapped at the door and
      was bidden to enter. A quantity of powder vainly strove to hide the traces
      of recent tears on her pretty face. She was a swollen-featured, piteous
      little butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; asked Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better, much better. They have taken out the bullet. There is no danger,
      and he has recovered consciousness. I almost wish he hadn't. Oh, Norma
      dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke down and sat on the bed and sobbed. Norma came up and laid her
      hand on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you don't believe this ghastly story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fair head nodded above the handkerchief. A voice came from-below it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must&mdash;it's horrible&mdash;Jimmie, of all men! I thought his life
      was so sweet and clean&mdash;almost like a good woman's&mdash;I can't
      understand it. If he is as bad as this, what must other men be like? I
      feel as if I shall never be able to look a man in the face again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you take it for granted that he has done this?&rdquo; asked
      Norma, tonelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Deering raised her face and looked at her friend in blue-eyed dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't take it for granted. He told me so himself. Otherwise do you
      think I should have believed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you so himself! When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A short while ago. I went into his room. I could n't help it&mdash;I felt
      as if I should have gone mad if I didn't know the truth. Parsons was there
      with him. She said I could come in. He smiled at me in his old way, and
      that smile is enough to make any woman fall in love with him. 'You've been
      crying, Connie,' he said. 'That's very foolish of you.' So I began to cry
      more. You would have cried if you had heard him. I asked him how he was
      feeling. He said he had never felt so well in his life. Then I blurted it
      out. I know I was a beast, but it was more than I could stand. 'Tell me
      that this madman's story was all lies.' He looked at me queerly, waited
      for a second or two, and then moved his head. 'It's all true,' he said,
      'all true.' 'But you must have some explanation!' I cried. He shut his
      eyes as if he were tired and said I must take the facts as they were. Then
      Parsons came up and said I mustn't excite him, and sent me out of the
      room. But I did n't want to hear any more. I had heard enough, had n't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma, as she listened to the little lady's tale, felt her heart grow cold
      and heavy. Doubt was no longer possible. The man himself had spoken. He
      had not even pleaded extenuating circumstances; had merely admitted the
      plain, brutal facts. He had gone under a feigned name, seduced an honest
      girl, abandoned her, driven her to tragedy. It was all too simple to need
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are we to do, dear?&rdquo; cried Connie, as Norma made no remark, but
      stood motionless and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we had better drop his acquaintance,&rdquo; she replied with bitter
      irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie flinched at the tone, being a tender-natured woman. She retorted
      with some spirit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you have any heart at all, Norma. And I thought you cared
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I cared for him?&rdquo; Norma repeated slowly and cuttingly while
      her eyes hardened. &ldquo;What right had you to form such an opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People can form any opinions they like, my dear,&rdquo; said Connie. &ldquo;That was
      mine. And on the terrace this afternoon you know you cared. If ever a
      woman gave herself away over a man, it was Norma Hardacre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was n't Norma Hardacre, I assure you. It was a despicable fool whom I
      will ask you to forget. My mother was for putting it into a madhouse. She
      was quite right. Anyhow it has ceased to exist and I am the real Norma
      Hardacre again. Humanity is afflicted, it seems, periodically with a
      peculiar disease. It turns men into beasts and women into idiots. I have
      quite recovered, my dear Connie, and if you'll kindly go down and ask them
      to keep dinner back for five minutes, I'll dress and come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell for her maid. Connie rose from the bed. She longed to
      make some appeal to the other's softer nature for her own sake, as she had
      held Jimmie very dear and felt the need of sympathy in her trouble and
      disillusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But knowing that from the rock of that cynical mood no water would gush
      forth for any one's magic, she recognised the inefficacy of her own
      guileless arts, and forbore to exercise them. She sighed for answer. By
      chance her glance fell upon Norma's skirt. Human instinct, not altogether
      feminine, seized upon the trivial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, whatever have you been doing to your dress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma looked down, and for the first time noticed the disfiguring smears
      of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have spilt something,&rdquo; she said, turning away quickly, and
      beginning to unfasten the hooks and eyes of her neckband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will come out,&rdquo; said Connie. &ldquo;It's such a pretty frock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was alone, Norma looked at the stains with unutterable
      repulsion. She tore off the dress feverishly and threw it into a corner.
      When her maid entered in response to her summons, she pointed to the
      shapeless heap of crêpe and embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that away and burn it,&rdquo; she said.

      Chapter XVI&mdash;IN THE WILDERNESS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ORMA went down to
      dinner resolved to present a scornful front to public opinion. She found
      the effort taxed her strength. During the night her courage deserted her.
      The cold glitter of triumph in her mother's eyes had been intolerable. Her
      father, generally regarded with contemptuous indifference, had goaded her
      beyond endurance with his futile upbraiding. Aline had arrived,
      white-faced and questioning, and had established herself by Jimmie's
      bedside. Norma shrank from the ordeal of the daily meeting with her and
      the explanation that would inevitably come. She dreaded the return of
      Morland, uncertain of her own intentions. As she tossed about on her
      pillow, she loathed the idea of the marriage. Innermost sex had spoken for
      one passionate moment, and its message still vibrated. She knew that time
      might dull the memory; she knew that her will might one day triumph over
      such things as sex and sentiment; but she must have a breathing space, a
      period of struggle, of reflection, above all, of disassociation from
      present surroundings. If she sold herself, it must be in the accustomed
      cold atmosphere of brain and heart. Not now, when her head burned and
      flaming swords were piercing her through and through. And last, and chief
      of all her dreads, was the wounded man now sleeping beneath that roof.
      Father, mother, Aline, Morland&mdash;these, torture though it were, she
      could still steel her nerves to meet; but him, never. He had done what no
      other man in the wide world had done. He had awakened the sleeping,
      sacredest inmost of her, and he had dealt it a deadly wound. If she could
      have consumed him and all the memories surrounding him with fire, as she
      had consumed the garment stained with his blood, she would have done so in
      these hours of misery. And fierce among the bewildering conflict of
      emotions that raged through the long night was one that filled her with
      overwhelming disgust&mdash;a horrible, almost grotesque jealousy of the
      dead girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, exhausted, she resolved on immediate flight. In the little
      village of Penwyrn on the Cornish coast, her aunt Janet Hardacre led a
      remote, Quakerish existence. The reply to a telegram before she left her
      room assured Norma of a welcome. By eleven o'clock she had left Heddon
      Court and was speeding westwards without a word to Jimmie or Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland returned in the afternoon, and after a whisky and soda to brace
      his nerves, at once sought Jimmie, who roused himself with an effort to
      greet his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting on famously, I hear,&rdquo; said Morland, with forced airiness. &ldquo;So
      glad. We'll have you on your feet in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to be able to travel back to London to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jimmie, with a curious smile. &ldquo;I fear I have outstayed my
      welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Morland, seating himself at the foot of the bed.
      &ldquo;We'll put all that right. But you will give one a little time, won't you?
      You mustn't think you've been altogether left. I ran up to town at once to
      see my solicitors&mdash;not my usual people, you know, but some others,
      devilish smart fellows at this sort of thing. They'll see that nothing
      gets into the beastly papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see that it matters much,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;
 </p>
    <p>
Why, of course it does.
      I'm not going to let you take the whole blame. I could n't come forward
      yesterday, it was all so sudden. The scandal would have rotted my election
      altogether. But you shall be cleared&mdash;at any rate in the eyes of this
      household. I came down with the intention of telling Norma, but she has
      bolted to Cornwall. Upset, I suppose. However, as soon as she comes back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let things be as they are,&rdquo; interrupted Jimmie, closing his eyes for a
      moment wearily, for he had been suffering much bodily pain. &ldquo;When I said I
      was David Rendell, I meant it. I can go on acting the part. It's pretty
      easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, my dear old chap,&rdquo; said Morland, with an air of heartiness.
      &ldquo;You went into the affair with your eyes shut. You didn't know it was such
      a horrible mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more reason for Norma to remain ignorant. It was for her sake as
      well as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A peculiar tenderness in Jimmie's tone caused Morland, not usually
      perceptive, to look at him sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very keen upon Norma,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie closed his eyes again, and smiled. He was very weak and tired. The
      pain of his wound and a certain mental agitation had kept him awake all
      night, and just before Morland entered he had been dropping off to sleep
      for the first time. An unconquerable drowsiness induced irresponsibility
      of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The desire of the moth for the star,'&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland slid from the bed to his feet, and with his hands in his pockets
      gazed in astonishment at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      An entirely novel state of affairs dawned upon him which required a few
      moments to bring into focus. The ghastly tragedy for which he was
      responsible, presenting itself luridly at every instant of the night and
      day, had hidden from his reminiscent vision Norma's rush down the slope.
      and her scared tending of the unconscious man. Jimmie's words brought back
      the scene with unpleasant vividness and provided the interpretation. When
      he saw this clearly, he was the most amazed man in the three kingdoms.
      That Jimmie should have conceived and nourished a silly, romantic passion
      for Norma, although he had never interested himself sufficiently in
      Jimmie's private affairs to suspect it, was humorously comprehensible.
      Ludicrously incomprehensible, however, was a reciprocation of the
      sentiment on the part of Norma. In spite of remorse, in spite of anxiety,
      in spite of the struggle between cowardice and manhood, his uppermost
      sensation at that moment was one of lacerated vanity. He had been
      hoodwinked, befooled, deceived. His own familiar friend had betrayed him;
      the woman he was about to honour with his name had set him at naught. He
      tingled with anger and sense of wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man opened his eyes drowsily, and seeing Morland's gaze full
      upon him, started into wakefulness. He motioned him to come nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you marry Norma&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I marry her!&rdquo; cried Morland. &ldquo;Of course I'm going to marry her. I'll
      see any other man damned before he marries her! She's the only woman in
      the world I've ever set my mind on, and no matter what happens, I'm going
      to marry her. There are no damned if's about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there are,&rdquo; Jimmie retorted weakly. &ldquo;I was going to preach, but I'm
      too tired. You'll have to be especially good to her&mdash;to make up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the wrong done to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland was silent. He went up to the window and stared out across the
      lawns and tugged at his moustache. The reproach stung him, and he felt
      that Jimmie was ungenerous. After all, he had only done what thousands of
      other men had done with impunity. The consequences had been enough to
      drive him mad, but they had been the hideous accident of a temperament for
      which he had not been responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely don't believe all that mad fool said yesterday?&rdquo; he muttered
      without turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The promise of marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a crazy invention. There never was any question of marriage. I told
      you so months ago. I did everything in my power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland made no reply, but continued to stare out of the window and
      meditate upon the many injuries that fate had done him. He arraigned
      himself before the bar of his wounded vanity. He had broken the moral law
      and deserved a certain penalty. The magnanimous verdict received the
      applause of an admiring self. He was willing to undergo an adequate
      punishment&mdash;the imposition of a fine and the hard labour of setting
      devious things straight. But the alternative sentence to which he saw
      himself condemned&mdash;on the one hand, the ruin of his political career,
      his social position, and his marriage with Norma, to all of which he clung
      with a newly found passion, and on the other, ignoble shelter behind an
      innocent man who had done him a great wrong&mdash;he rebelled against with
      all his average, sensual Briton's sense of justice. It was grossly unfair.
      If there had been a spiritual &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; he would have written to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening of the door caused him to turn round with a start. It was
      Aline, anxious and pale from an all-night sitting by Jimmie's bedside, but
      holding her slim body erect, and wearing the uncompromising air of a
      mother who has found her child evilly entreated at the hands of strangers.
      She glanced at the bed and at Morland; then she put her finger to her lip,
      and pointed at Jimmie, who lay fast asleep. Morland nodded and went on
      tiptoe out of the room. Aline looked round, and being a sensitive young
      person, shivered. She threw open the window wide, as if to rid the place
      of his influence. Jimmie stirred slightly. She bent down and kissed his
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the dark and troubled time that followed, Morland fell away from
      Jimmie like the bosom friend of a mediaeval artist stricken with the Black
      Death. At first, common decency impelled him to send the tainted one
      affectionate messages, invitations to trust him awhile longer, and
      enlarged, with the crudity of his mental habit, on the noble aspects of
      Jimmie's sacrifice. But after Jimmie left the Hardacres' house, which
      happened as soon as he could bear the journey, Morland shrank from meeting
      him face to face; and when public exposure came, the messages and the
      invitations and the protestations ceased, and Jimmie was left in
      loneliness upon a pinnacle of infamy. Morland, in the futile hope of the
      weak-willed man that he could, by some astonishing chance, sail a middle
      course, did indeed give himself peculiar pains to keep the story out of
      the newspapers, and his ill-success was due to other causes than his own
      lack of effort. It was a tale too picturesque to be wasted in these days
      of sensation-hunger. The fact of the dénouement of the tragedy having
      taken place in the presence of royalty lent it a theatrical glamour. A
      sardonic press filled an Athenian public with what it lusted after.
      Indeed, who shall say with authority that the actual dramas re-enacted
      before our courts and reported in our newspapers have not their value in
      splashing with sudden colour the drab lives of thousands? May it not be
      better for the dulled soul to be occasionally arrested by the
      contemplation of furious passions than to feed contentedly like a pig
      beside the slaughtered body of its fellow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may. The press paid no heed to Morland or the smart fellows
      of solicitors whom he employed. It published as many details as it could
      discover or invent. For the tragical business did not end with the scene
      on the Hardacres' lawn. There was an inquest on the dead girl. There was
      the trial of Daniel Stone for attempted murder. The full glare of
      publicity shed itself upon the sordid history. In the one case the jury
      gave a verdict of suicide during temporary insanity; in the other the
      prisoner was found to be insane and was sent to an asylum. These were
      matters of no great public interest. But letters to the dead girl in a
      disguised handwriting were discovered, and Stone gave his crazy evidence,
      and a story of heartless seduction under solemn promise of marriage and of
      abandonment with cynical offer of money was established, and the
      fashionable portrait-painter, who was supposed to be the hero of the tale,
      awoke one morning and found himself infamous. The thing, instead of
      remaining a mere police-court commonplace, became a society scandal.
      Exaggeration was inevitable, not only of facts but of the reprobation a
      virtuous community pronounces on the specially pilloried wrongdoer. The
      scapegoat in its essential significance is by no means a thing of
      legendary history. It exists still, and owes its existence to an
      ineradicable instinct in human nature. The reprobation aforesaid is due
      not entirely to hypocrisy, as the social satirist would have it, but in a
      great measure to an unreasoning impulse towards expiation of offences by
      horrified condemnation of some notorious other. Thus it came to pass that
      upon Jimmie's head were put all the iniquities of the people and all their
      transgressions in all their sins, and he was led away into the social
      wilderness. After that, the world forgot him. He had been obscure enough
      before he burst for a day into the blaze of royal patronage; but now
      blackest darkness swallowed him up. Only Aline remained by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland wrote to Jimmie once after the exposure. As he had been the cause,
      said he, of the probable ruin of Jimmie's professional prospects, it was
      only right that he should endeavour to make some compensation. It was,
      besides, a privilege of their life-long friendship. He enclosed a cheque
      for two thousand pounds. Jimmie returned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Morland,&rdquo; he wrote in answer, &ldquo;loyalty can only be repaid by
      loyalty, love by love. If I accepted money, it would dishonour both
      yourself and me. It is true that I took upon me a greater burden than I
      was aware of. The world, if it knew the facts, would, as you say, call me
      a quixotic fool. But if I took your money it would have the right to call
      me a mercenary knave. I have always suffered fools gladly, myself the
      greatest. I can go on doing so. Meanwhile you can make full compensation
      in the only way possible. Devote your life and energies to the happiness
      of the woman you are about to marry.&rdquo; This was a stern letter for Jimmie
      to write. After he had posted it he reproached himself for not having put
      in a kind word.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII&mdash;THE INCURABLE MALADY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> 'll never let you
      inside the house again until you go down on your knees and beg Jimmie's
      pardon,&rdquo; cried Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood, a slim incarnation of outraged womanhood, with her hand on the
      knob of the open door. A scared but stubborn youth hesitated on the
      threshold. Few men, least of all lovers, like being turned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you care a hang for me!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; she retorted bravely, but with tremulous lip. &ldquo;Not a hang, as
      you call it. I dislike you exceedingly and I don't want to see you any
      more. I'll never speak to anybody who believes such things of Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my good child,&rdquo; expostulated Tony Merewether, &ldquo;they are facts; he
      never has denied them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could if he liked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; Aline repeated scornfully. &ldquo;That just shows how far we
      are apart. There's not the slightest reason for talking any more. You have
      insulted Jimmie and you are going on insulting him. I can't stand by this
      door forever. I want you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, I'll go,&rdquo; said the young fellow. &ldquo;But you've behaved
      damnably to me, Aline&mdash;simply damnably.&rdquo; He strode down the passage
      and slammed the front door behind him. Aline turned back into the prim
      little drawing-room where the interview had taken place, and after an
      attempt to remain composed and dignified, suddenly broke into tears. She
      could struggle no more against the cruelty of man and the hopelessness of
      life. It had been a stormy interview. Tony Merewether had come, as her
      natural protector, to insist upon immediate marriage. A small legacy
      recently bequeathed to him would enable them to marry with reasonable
      prudence. Why should they wait? Aline pleaded for time. How could she
      leave her beloved Jimmie in his blackest hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just because I don't think it quite right for you to live here any
      longer, that I want you to come away at once,&rdquo; Tony had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not right to live here? What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; The luckless lover
      tried to explain. Aline regarded him icily, and in his confusion and
      discomfiture he lost the careful wrappings which he had prepared for his
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that Jimmie is not a fit person for me to associate with?&rdquo; she
      had asked in a dangerous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, since you choose to put it that way,&rdquo; he had replied, nettled. He
      believed that women liked a man of spirit and generally yielded to a show
      of masterfulness. He was very young. Taking up his parable with greater
      confidence, he showed her the social and moral necessity of immediate
      recourse to his respectable protection. Naturally he admired her loyalty,
      he signified, with a magnanimous wave of the hand; but there were certain
      things girls did not quite comprehend; a man's judgment had to be trusted.
      He invited her to surrender entirely to his wisdom. The end of it all was
      his ignominious dismissal. She would not see him until he had begged
      Jimmie's pardon on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now she buried her face in the sofa-cushions and sobbed. It was her
      first poignant disillusion. Tony, whom she loved with all her heart, was
      just like everybody else, incapable of pure faith, ready to believe the
      worst. He was cruel, uncharitable. She would never speak to him again. And
      the sweet shy dream of her young life was over. It was very tragical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie's step coming up the studio stairs caused her to spring from the
      sofa and frantically dry her eyes before the mirror. The steps advanced
      along the passage, and soon Jimmie's head appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you hidden the little watercolour box?&rdquo; he asked cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the cupboard. On the second shelf,&rdquo; she replied, without turning
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught sight of the reflection of a tear-stained face, and came and
      stood by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you've been crying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I have,&rdquo; she admitted with affectionate defiance, looking up
      into his face. &ldquo;Why should n't I, if I like? It's not a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's worse&mdash;it's a blunder,&rdquo; he quoted with a smile. &ldquo;It can't do
      any one any good, and it makes your pretty nose red. That will spoil your
      good looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it would. My looks will never matter to anybody,&rdquo; she said
      desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm round her shoulders, just as he had done since she could
      remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to distress you&mdash;more than usual?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, and hung her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've broken off with Tony,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll mend it up with Tony at once, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never marry him,&rdquo; declared Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll write and tell him that you'll marry him at the very first
      opportunity. There are reasons why you should, Aline, grave reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't have me marry any one I dislike intensely?&rdquo; she flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't you do it to please me, even though you hated him violently? I
      have been going to speak to you about this. It's high time you were
      married, dear, and I particularly wish it. So make friends with Tony as
      soon as ever you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never want to see Tony again&mdash;until he has gone on his bended
      knees to you,&rdquo; said Aline, with a quivering lip. &ldquo;I don't want to breathe
      the same air with any one who does n't think of you as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first allusion that the girl had made to unhappy things,
      since they had become common knowledge a month ago. She had conveyed to
      him by increased tenderness and devotion that she loved him all the more
      for his suffering, and it had been easy for him to perceive that the main
      facts of the story were not unknown to her. But hitherto there had been
      absolute silence on the part of each. He had been greatly puzzled as to
      the proper course he should take. An interview with Tony Merewether that
      morning had decided him. It had been short, coldly courteous on the young
      fellow's side, who merely asked and obtained consent to marry Aline
      forthwith, and wistfully dignified on Jimmie's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the arm of a chair and took her hand, deeply moved by her
      passionate faith in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, dear. I am a dishonoured man and it is n't right that you should
      live with me any longer. Tony, dear good fellow, is no more to blame for
      what he thinks of me than the crazy wronged man who shot me. But the only
      way for you to make him think better is to marry him. No, don't interrupt.
      Stand quietly and let me talk to you. I've been making plans and I should
      be tremendously upset if there was any difficulty. I'm going to give up
      the house and studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline regarded him in frightened amazement, and then looked round as if
      the familiar walls and furniture were in danger of incontinent
      disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall give it up and wander about painting abroad, so it's absolutely
      necessary that you should marry Tony. Otherwise I don't know what on earth
      I should do with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung her hand and looked smilingly into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I really am in a hurry to get rid of you,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aline gazed at him for a long time, gradually recovering from her
      stupefaction. Then she withdrew her hand from his clasp and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are talking unadulterated rubbish, Jimmie,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this declaration she took her stand, and no protest or argument could
      move her. She withstood triumphantly a siege of several days. Jimmie tried
      to exert his quasiparental authority. But the submissive little girl, who
      had always yielded when Jimmie claimed obedience, had given place to a
      calmly inflexible woman. Jimmie swore that he would not commit the crime
      of spoiling her life's happiness. She replied, with a toss of her head and
      a pang of her heart, that her life's happiness had nothing to do with Tony
      Merewether, and that if it did, the crime would lie at his door and not at
      Jimmie's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for leaving you alone in the wide world, I would just as soon think of
      deserting a new-born baby in the street,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are not fit to be
      by yourself. And whether you like it or not, Jimmie, I must stay and look
      after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, by the underhand methods which women often employ for the greater
      comfort of men, she cajoled him into an admission. The plan of giving up
      the house had, as its sole object, the forcing of her hand. Victorious,
      she allowed herself to shed tears over his goodness. Just for her
      miserable sake he had proposed to turn himself into a homeless wanderer
      over the face of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me, Jimmie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how it feels to be an angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed in his old bright way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very uncomfortable when a tyrannical young woman cuts your wings off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do it for your good, Jimmie,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;If I did n't, you
      would be flying about helplessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the clouds that lay around them were lit with tender jesting. During
      this passage through the darkness he never faltered, serene in his faith,
      having found triumphant vindication thereof in the devotion of Aline. That
      he had made a sacrifice greater than any human being had a right to demand
      of another, he knew full well; he had been driven on to more perilous
      reefs than he had contemplated; the man whom he had imagined Morland to be
      would have thrown all planks of safety to the waves in order to rescue
      him. He felt acutely the pain of his shipwreck; but he did not glorify
      himself as a martyr: he was satisfied that it was for the worshipped
      woman's happiness, and that in itself was a reward. His catholic sympathy
      even found extenuating circumstances in Morland's conduct. Once when Aline
      inveighed against his desertion, he said in the grave manner in which he
      delivered himself of his moral maxims:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought never to judge a human being's actions until we know his
      motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline thought the actions were quite sufficient for a working philosophy,
      but she did not say so. Jimmie half guessed the motives and judged
      leniently. Though he had lost much that made life sweet to him, his heart
      remained unchanged, his laugh rang true through the house; and were it not
      for the loneliness and the dismal blight in her own little soul, Aline
      would not have realised that any calamitous event had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other of Jimmie's friends maintained relations with him. This was
      Connie Deering. She had gone abroad soon after the disaster, and moved by
      various feelings for which she rather forbade her impulsive self to
      account, had written one or two oddly expressed letters. In the first one
      she had touched lightly upon the difficult subject. She would not have
      believed a word of it, if she had not heard it from his own lips. If he
      would write to her and say that it was all a lie, she would accept his
      word implicitly. He was either a god or a devil&mdash;a remark that filled
      Jimmie with considerable alarm. A shrewd brain was inside the pretty
      butterfly head. In his reply he ignored the question, an example which
      Connie followed in her second letter. This consisted mainly in a rambling
      account of the beauty of Stresa and the comforts and excellent cuisine of
      the hotel by the lake; but a postscript informed him that Norma was
      travelling about with her for an indefinite period, and that she had heard
      nothing of Morland, who having easily won his election was now probably
      busy with the beginning of the autumn session. Jimmie, unversed in the
      postscriptal ways of women, accepted the information as merely the literal
      statement of facts. A wiser man would have grasped the delicate
      implication that the relations between the affianced pair were so strained
      that an interval of separation had seemed desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unshaken faith of the man in the ultimate righteousness of things kept
      him serene; but the young girl who had no special faith, save in the
      perfect righteousness of Jimmie and the dastardly unrighteousness of the
      world in general and of Mr. Anthony Merewether in particular, found it
      difficult to live in these high altitudes of philosophy. Indeed she was a
      very miserable little girl when Jimmie was not by, and pined, and cried
      her heart out, and grew thin and pale and sharp-tempered, and filled her
      guardian with much concern. At last Jimmie took heroic measures. Without
      Aline's knowledge he summoned Tony Merewether to an interview. The young
      man came. Jimmie received him in the studio, begged him to take a seat,
      and rang the bell. The middle-aged housekeeper ran down in some
      perturbation at the unusual summons, for it was Jimmie's habit to shout up
      the stairs, generally to Aline, for anything he wanted. She received his
      instructions. Miss Aline would oblige him by coming down at once. During
      the interval of waiting he talked to Mr. Merewether of indifferent things,
      flattering himself on a sudden development of the diplomatic faculty.
      Aline ran into the room, and stopped short at the sight of the young man,
      uttering a little cry of indignant surprise. Jimmie cleared his throat,
      but the oration that he had prepared was never delivered. Aline marched
      straight up to the offending lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see you on your knees,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony, who was entirely unexpectant of this uncompromising attitude, having
      taken it for granted that by some means or other the way had been made
      smooth for him, retorted somewhat sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not likely to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wonder,&rdquo; said Aline, &ldquo;at your audacity in coming to this house.&rdquo;
       She turned and marched back to the door, her little figure very erect and
      her dark eyes blazing. Jimmie intercepted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tony came at my request, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first and only time in her life she cast a look of anger upon
      Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me pass, please,&rdquo; she said, like an outraged princess; and waving
      Jimmie aside, she made the exit of offended majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked stupidly at each other. Their position was ignominious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it for the best, my boy,&rdquo; said Jimmie, taking up a pipe which he
      began to fill mechanically. He was just the kind creature of happier days.
      The young fellow's heart was touched. After a minute's silence he
      committed a passionate indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to God you would tell me there is something hidden beneath this
      ghastly story, and that it's quite different from what it appears to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie drew himself up and looked the young man between the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a question I discuss with no human being,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Tony Merewether, in sincere apology. &ldquo;I would
      not have taken such a liberty if it had n't been a matter of life and
      death for me. Perhaps you think I ought to do more or less as Aline asks
      me; but she is too precious to purchase with an infernal lie. I'm hanged
      if I'll do it, and I don't think you're the man to misunderstand my
      frankness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie had lit his pipe during the foregoing speech. He drew two or three
      meditative puffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have as little to do with lies, my boy, as ever you can,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And
      cheer up, all is sure to come right in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sunk in reflection for a long time after the young man had gone,
      and again for a long time after Aline had done remorseful penance for her
      loss of temper. Then he went out for a walk and brought back something in
      his pocket. At dinner-time he was unusually preoccupied. When the meal was
      over, he fished up a black bottle from beneath the table, and going to the
      sideboard, came back with a couple of wineglasses. Aline watched him as
      though he were performing some rite in black magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is rich fruity port,&rdquo; said he, filling the glasses. &ldquo;Evans, the
      grocer, told me I should get nothing like it at the price in London. You
      are to drink it. It will do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline, still penitent, obeyed meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you be so extravagant, Jimmie?&rdquo; she said in mild protest. &ldquo;It
      must have cost quite three shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sixpence,&rdquo; said Jimmie, unabashed. He lifted up his glass. &ldquo;Now
      here's to our <i>Wanderjahr</i>, or as much of it as we can run to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever do you mean, Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we are going to take a knapsack, a
      tambourine and a flute, and appropriate ribbons for our costumes, and beg
      our way through southern Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He explained and developed his plan, the result of his meditations, in his
      laughing picturesque way. They were doing nothing but eating expensive fog
      in November London. A diet of sunshine and garlic would be cheaper. They
      would walk under the olive-trees and drift about on lagoons, and whisper
      with dead ages in the moonlit gloom of crumbling palaces. They would go
      over hills on donkeys. They would steep their souls in Perugino, Del
      Sarto, Giorgione. They would teach the gaunt Italian flea to respect
      British Keating's powder. They would fraternise with the beautiful maidens
      of Arles and sit on the top of Giotto's Campanile. They would do all kinds
      of impossible things. Afford it? Of course they could. Had he not received
      his just dues from the princess and sold two pictures a week or two ago?
      At this point he fell thinking for a couple of dreamy minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to give you a carriage, dear,&rdquo; he said at last in mild apology.
      &ldquo;I'm afraid it will have to be a third-class one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fourth or fifth would be good enough for me,&rdquo; cried Aline. &ldquo;Or I could
      walk all the way with you. Don't I know you have planned it out just for
      my sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish, my dear,&rdquo; said Jimmie, holding the precious wine to the light.
      &ldquo;I'm taking you because I don't see how I can leave you behind. You have
      no idea what an abominable nuisance you'll be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline laughed a joyous laugh which did Jimmie good to hear, and came
      behind his chair and put her arms about his neck, behaving foolishly as a
      young girl penetrated with the sense of the loved one's goodness is
      privileged to do. What she said is of infinitesimal importance, but it
      lifted care from Jimmie's heart and made him as happy as a child. Like two
      children, they discussed the project; and Aline fetching from the top
      shelf of the bookcase in Jimmie's bedroom a forlorn, dusty, yellow-paged
      Continental Bradshaw, twenty years old, they looked up phantom trains that
      had long ceased running, speculated on the merits of dead-and-gone hotels,
      and plunged into the fairyland of anachronistic information.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days were enough for Jimmie's simple arrangements; and then began
      the pilgrimage of these two, each bearing a burden, a heart-ache, a pain
      from which there was no escaping, but each bearing it with a certain
      splendour of courage that made life beautiful to the other. For the girl
      suffered keenly, as Jimmie knew. She had given a passionate heart for good
      and all to the handsome young fellow who had refused to bow the knee to
      the man whom he had every reason to consider a blackguard. They had come
      together, youth to youth, as naturally as two young birds in the first
      mating-season; but, fortunately or unfortunately for Aline, she was not a
      bird, but a human being of unalterable affections and indomitable
      character. She had the glorious faith, <i>quia incredibile</i>, in Jimmie,
      and rather than swerve aside from it she would have walked on knife edges
      all the rest of her days. So she scorned the pain, and scorned herself for
      feeling it when she saw the serenity with which he bore his cross. Dimly
      she felt that if the truth were known he would stand forth heroically, not
      infamously. She had revered him as a child does its father; but in that
      sweet and pure relationship of theirs, she had also watched him with the
      minute, jealous solicitude that a mother devotes to an only child who is
      incapable of looking after itself. Nothing in his character had escaped
      her. She knew both his strength and his enchanting weaknesses. To her
      trained eyes, he was all but transparent; and of late her quickened vision
      had read in letters of fire across his heart, &ldquo;The desire of the moth for
      the star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they travelled through the world, hand in hand, as it were, and drank
      together of its beauty. They were memorable journeyings. Sleeping-cars and
      palatial hotels and the luxuries of modern travel were not for them.
      Aline, who knew that Jimmie, as far as he himself was concerned, would
      have slept upon wood quite as cheerfully as upon feathers, but for her
      sake would have royally commanded down, held the purse-strings and
      dictated the expenditure. They had long, wonderful third-class journeys,
      stopping at every wayside station, at each having some picturesque change
      of company in the ever-crowded, evil-smelling, wooden-seated compartment.
      She laughed at Jimmie's fears as to her discomfort; protested with
      energetic sincerity that this was the only way in the world to travel with
      enjoyment. It was a never-failing interest to see Jimmie disarm the
      suspicion of peasants by his sympathetic knowledge of their interests, to
      listen to his arguments with the chance-met curé, perspiring and polite,
      or the mild young soldier in a brass helmet a size too big for him. In
      France she understood what they were saying, and maintained a proper
      protectorate over Jimmie by means of a rough and ready acquaintance with
      the vernacular. But in Italy she was dumb, could only regard Jimmie in
      open-mouthed astonishment and admiration. He spoke Italian. She had known
      him all her life and never suspected this accomplishment. It required some
      tact to keep him in his proper position as interpreter and restrain him
      from acting on his own initiative. In the towns they put up at little
      humble hostelries in by-streets and in country-places at rough inns,
      eating rude fare and drinking sour wine with great content. The more they
      economised the longer would the idyllic vagabondage last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through southern France and northern Italy they wandered without fixed
      plans, going from place to place as humour seized them, seeking the
      sunshine. At last it seemed to be their normal existence. London with its
      pain and its passion grew remote like the remembered anguish of a dream.
      Few communications reached them. The local newspaper gave them all the
      tidings they needed of the great world. It was a life free from vexation.
      The decaying splendour of the larger cities with their treasure-houses of
      painting and sculpture and their majestic palaces profoundly stirred the
      young girl's imagination and widened her conceptions and sympathies. But
      she loved best to arrive by a crazy, old-world diligence at some little
      townlet built on a sunny hillside, whose crumbling walls were the haunts
      of lizards and birds and strange wild-flowers; and having rested and eaten
      at the dark little <i>albergo</i>, smelling of wine and garlic and all
      Italian smells, to saunter out with Jimmie through the narrow, ill-paved,
      clattering streets alive with brown children and dark-eyed mothers, and
      men sitting on doorsteps violently gesticulating and screaming over the
      game of <i>morra</i>, and to explore the impossible place from end to end.
      A step or two when they desired it would bring them to the sudden peace of
      the mediaeval church, with its memories of Romanesque tradition and faint
      stirrings of Gothic curiously reflecting the faith of its builders; the
      rough, weather-beaten casket of one flawless gem of art, a Virgin smiling
      over the child on her lap at many generations of worshippers, superbly
      eternal and yet quaintly woman. And then they would pass out of the chilly
      streets and down the declivitous pathways below the town and sit together
      on the hillside, in a sun-baked spot sheltered from the wind. This Aline,
      vaguely conscious of the Infinite, called &ldquo;hanging on the edge of
      Nowhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day, on such a hillside Jimmie had been painting three brown-faced
      children whom he had cajoled into posing for him, while Aline looked on
      dreamily. The urchins, dismissed with a few halfpennies, bowed polite
      thanks, the two boys taking off their caps with the air of ragged princes,
      and scampered away like rabbits out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Jimmie, throwing down his brush and holding out the little
      panel at arm's length. &ldquo;I have never done anything so good in all my life!
      Have n't I got it? Is n't it better than ten cathedralfuls of sermons? Is
      n't it the quintessence of happiness, the perfect trust in the sweet earth
      to yield them its goodness? Could any one after seeing that dare say the
      world was only a dank and dismal prison where men do nothing but sit and
      hear each other groan? Look at it, Aline. What do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just lovely, Jimmie,&rdquo; said Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I painted a pink hippopotamus standing on its head, you would say it
      was lovely. Why did n't you tell me that arm was out of drawing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up his brush and made the necessary correction. Aline laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know one of the few things I can remember my father saying was
      about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;I had almost forgotten you ever had a
      father&mdash;dear old chap! What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember him telling you that one day you would die of incurable
      optimism. For years I used to think it was some horrible disease, and I
      used to whisper in my prayers, 'O God, please cure Jimmie of optimism,'
      and sometimes lie awake at nights thinking of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you think your prayer has been answered?&rdquo; asked Jimmie, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shifted herself a little nearer him and put her hand on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness, no. You've got it as bad as ever&mdash;and I believe I've
      caught it.&rdquo; Then, between a sob and a laugh, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jimmie dear, your stupid old head could never tell you what you have
      done for me since we have been abroad. If I had stayed at home I think I
      should have died of&mdash;of&mdash;of malignant pessimism. You will never,
      never, never understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you ever understand what you have done for me, my child?&rdquo; said
      Jimmie, gravely. &ldquo;We won't talk about these things. They are best in our
      hearts.&rdquo;

      Chapter XVIII&mdash;A RUDDERLESS SHIP
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT autumn pressed
      heavily upon Mrs. Hardacre. Norma's engagement, without being broken off,
      was indefinitely suspended, and Norma, by going abroad with Mrs. Deering
      immediately on her return from Cornwall, had placed herself beyond reach
      of maternal influence. It is true that Mrs. Hardacre wrote many letters;
      but as Norma's replies mainly consisted of a line or two on a picture
      post-card, it is to be doubted whether she ever read them. Mrs. Hardacre
      began to feel helpless. Morland could give her little assistance. He
      shrugged his shoulders at her appeals. He was perfectly determined to
      marry Norma, but trusted to time to restore her common-sense and lead her
      into the path of reason. Nothing that he could do would be of any avail.
      Mrs. Hardacre urged him to join the ladies on the Continent and bring
      matters to a crisis. He replied that an election was crisis enough for one
      man in a year, and furthermore the autumn session necessitated his
      attendance in the House. He was quite satisfied, he told her stolidly,
      with things as they were, and in the meantime was actually finding an
      interest in his new political life. But Mrs. Hardacre shared neither his
      satisfaction nor his interest, a mother's point of view being so different
      from that of a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if the loss of ducal favour and filial obedience were not enough for
      the distraught lady, her husband one morning threw a business letter upon
      the table, and with petulant curses on the heads of outside brokers,
      incoherently explained that he was ruined. They were liars and knaves and
      thieves, he sputtered. He would drag them all into the police court, he
      would write to the &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; he would go and horsewhip the blackguards.
      Damme if he would n't!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the blackguards could horsewhip you,&rdquo; remarked his wife, grimly.
      &ldquo;Have you sufficient brains to realise what an unutterable fool you have
      been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If he did not realise it by the end of the week, it was not Mrs.
      Hardacre's fault. She reduced the unhappy man to craven submission and
      surreptitious nipping of old brandy in order to keep up the feeble spirit
      that remained in him, and took the direction of affairs into her own
      hands. They were not ruined, but a considerable sum of money had been lost
      through semi-idiotic speculation, and for a time strict economy was
      necessary. By Christmas the establishment in the country was broken up, a
      tenant luckily found for Heddon Court, and a small furnished house taken
      in Devonshire Place. These arrangements gave Mrs. Hardacre much
      occupation, but they did not tend to soften her character. When Norma came
      home, sympathetically inclined and honestly desirous to smooth down
      asperities&mdash;for she appreciated the aggravating folly of her father&mdash;she
      found her advances coldly repulsed.
    </p>

      &ldquo;What is the good of saying you are sorry for me,&rdquo; Mrs. Hardacre asked
      snappishly, &ldquo;when you refuse to do the one thing that can mend matters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the old, old story which Norma had heard so often in days
      past, but now barbed with a new moral and adorned with new realism. Norma
      listened wearily, surprised at her own lack of retort. When the familiar
      homily came to an end, her reply was almost meek:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a little longer time to think over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better cut it as short as possible,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, &ldquo;or you
      may find yourself too late. As it is, you are going off. What have you
      been doing to yourself? You look thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel fifty,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go and have your face massaged, or you'll soon not be fit
      to be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I want a course of soul massage,&rdquo; answered Norma, with a hard
      little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she was alone in her own room, she looked anxiously at her face
      in the glass. Her mother had confirmed certain dismal imaginings. She had
      grown thinner, older looking; tiny lines were just perceptible at the
      corners of eyes and lips and across the forehead. The fresh bloom of youth
      was fading from her skin. She was certainly going off. She had not been a
      happy woman since her precipitate flight to Cornwall. The present
      discovery added anxiety to depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two afterwards Mrs. Hardacre returned to the unedifying attack.
      Had Norma written to Morland to inform him of her arrival? Norma replied
      that she had no inordinate longing to see Morland. Mrs. Hardacre used
      language that only hardened and soured women of fashion who are beginning
      to feel the pinch of poverty dare use nowadays. It is far more virulent
      than a fishwife's, for every phrase touches a jangling nerve and every
      gibe tears a delicate fibre, whereas Billingsgate merely shocks and
      belabours. Norma bore it in silence for some time, and then went away
      quivering from head to foot. A new and what seemed a horrible gift had
      been bestowed upon her&mdash;the power to feel. Once a sarcastic smile, a
      scornful glance, a withering retort would have carried her in triumph from
      her mother's presence. Secure in her own callous serenity, she would have
      given scarcely a further thought to the quarrel. Now things had
      inexplicably changed. Her mother's stabs hurt. Some curious living growth
      within her was wrung with pain. She could only grope humbled and broken to
      her room and stare at nothing, wishing she could cry like other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder she looked old, when the spirit had left her and taken with it
      the cold, proud setting of the features that had given her beauty its
      peculiar stamp. Dimly she realised the disintegration. When a nature which
      has taken a colossal vanity for strength and has relied thereon
      unquestioningly for protection against a perilous world, once loses grip
      of that sublime mainstay, it is impossible for it to take firm hold again.
      It must content itself with lesser planks or flounder helplessly, fearful
      of imminent shipwreck. Norma, during those autumn months, had found her
      strength vanity. The fact in rude, symbolic form was brought home to her a
      short time after her return.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright Sunday afternoon, when, on her way to pay a call in
      Kensington, she had dismissed her cab at Lancaster Gate and was walking
      through Kensington Gardens. Half-way a familiar figure met her eye. It was
      her own maid sitting on a bench with a man by her side. The girl was
      wearing a cheap long jacket over an elaborate dress, absurdly light for
      the time of year. It caught Norma's attention, and then suddenly it
      flashed upon her that it was the dress she had given to be burned months
      ago. She walked on, aching with a sense of the futility of grandiose
      determinations. She had consigned the garment stained with Jimmie's blood
      contemptuously to the flames. It was incongruously whole in Kensington
      Gardens. She had cast her love for Jimmie out of her heart in the same
      spirit of comedic tragedy. Forlorn and bedraggled it was still there,
      mockingly refusing to be reduced to its proper dust and ashes. Her
      strength had not availed her to cast it out. Her strength was a vain
      thing. Yet being forlorn and bedraggled the love was as hateful as the
      unconsumed garment. It haunted her like an unpurged offence. The newspaper
      details had made it reek disgustfully. At times Connie Deering's half
      faith filled her with an extravagant hope that these sordid horrors which
      had sullied the one pure and beautiful thing that had come into her life
      were nothing but a ghastly mistake; that it was, as Connie suggested, a
      dark mystery from which if Jimmie chose he could emerge clean. But then
      her judgment, trained from childhood to look below the surface of even
      smiling things and find them foul, rebelled. The man had proclaimed
      himself, written himself down a villain. It was in black and white. And
      not only a villain&mdash;that might be excusable&mdash;but a hypocritical
      canting villain, which was the unforgivable sin. Every woman has a Holy
      Ghost of sorts within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma did not write to Morland. She dreaded renewal of relations, and yet
      she had not the courage to cut him finally adrift. The thought of withered
      spinsterhood beneath her father's roof was a dismaying vision. Marriage
      was as essential as ever to the scheme of her future. Why not with
      Morland? Her mother's words, though spoken as with the tongues of asps,
      were those of wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that she could bring to a husband was her beauty, her superb presence,
      her air of royalty. These gone, her chances were as illusory as those of
      the pinched and faded gentlewomen who tittle-tattled at Cosford
      tea-parties. Another year, and at the present rate of decay her beauty
      would have vanished into the limbo of last year's snows. She exaggerated;
      but what young woman of six-and-twenty placed as she has not looked
      tremulously in her mirror and seen feet of crows and heaven knows what
      imaginary fowls that prey upon female charms? At six-and-thirty she smiles
      with wistful, longing regret at the remembered image. Yet youth, happily,
      is not cognisant of youth's absurdities. It takes itself tragically. Thus
      did Norma. Her dowry of beauty was dwindling. She must marry within the
      year. Sometimes she wished that Theodore Weever, who had not yet
      discovered his decorative wife and had managed to find himself at various
      places which she had visited abroad, would come like a Paladin and deliver
      her from her distress and carry her off to his castle in Fifth Avenue. He
      would at least interest her as a human being, which Morland, with all his
      solid British qualities, had never succeeded in doing. But Theodore Weever
      had not spoken. He retained the imperturbability of the bald marble bust
      of himself that he had taken her to see in a Parisian sculptor's studio.
      There only remained Morland. But for some reason, for which she could not
      account, he seemed the last man on earth she desired to marry. When she
      had written to him, soon after her flight to Cornwall, to beg for a
      postponement of the wedding, giving him the very vaguest reasons for her
      request, he had assented with a cheerfulness ill befitting an impatient
      lover. It would be impertinence, he wrote, for him to enquire further into
      her reasons. She was too much a woman of the world to act without due
      consideration, and provided that he could look forward to the very great
      happiness of one day calling her his wife, he was perfectly satisfied with
      whatever she chose to arrange. The absence of becoming fervour, in spite
      of her desire to postpone the dreaded day, produced a feeling of irritated
      disappointment. None of us, least of all women, invariably like to be
      taken at our word. If Morland lay so little value upon her as that, he
      might just as well give her up altogether. She replied impulsively,
      suggesting a rupture of the engagement. Morland, longing for time to raise
      him from the abasement in which he grovelled, had welcomed the proposal to
      defer the marriage; but as he smarted at the same time under a sense of
      wrong&mdash;had he not been betrayed by his own familiar friend and the
      woman he loved?&mdash;he now unequivocally refused to accept her
      suggestion. He had made up his mind to marry her. He had made all his
      arrangements for marrying her. The check he had experienced had stimulated
      a desire which only through unhappy circumstances had languished for a
      brief season. He persuaded himself that he was more in love with her than
      ever. At all costs, in his stupid, dogged way, he determined to marry her.
      He told her so bluntly. He merely awaited her good pleasure. Norma
      accepted the situation and thought, by going abroad, to leave it at home
      to take care of itself. It might die of inanition. Something miraculous
      might happen to transform it entirely. She returned and found it alive and
      quite undeveloped. It grinned at her with a leer which she loathed from
      the depths of her soul; and the more Mrs. Hardacre pointed at it the more
      it leered, and the greater became the loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mrs. Hardacre took matters into her own hands and summoned Morland
      to London. &ldquo;Norma is in a green, depressed state,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;and I think
      your proper place is by her side. I imagine she regrets her foolishness in
      postponing the marriage and is ashamed to confess it. A few words with you
      face to face would bring her back to her old self. Women have these
      idiotic ways, my dear Morland, and men being so much stronger and saner
      must make generous allowances. I confidently expect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland's vanity, spurred by this letter, brought him in a couple of days
      to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Morland, this is a surprise,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hardacre dissemblingly,
      as he entered the drawing-room, &ldquo;we were only just talking of you. I'll
      ring for another cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the bell by the side of the fireplace, and Norma and Morland
      shook hands with the conventional words of greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you've had a good time abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. The usual thing, the usual places, the usual people, the usual
      food. In fact, a highly successful pursuit of the usual. I've invented a
      verb&mdash;'to usualise.' I suppose you've been usualising too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden sight of him had braced her, and instinctively she had adopted
      her old, cool manner as defensive armour. Her reply pleased him. There was
      something pungent in her speech, irreconcilable in her attitude, which
      other women did not possess. He was not physiognomist or even perceptive
      enough to notice the subtle change in her expression. He noted, as he
      remarked to her later, that she was &ldquo;a bit off colour,&rdquo; but he attributed
      it to the muggy weather, and never dreamed of regarding her otherwise than
      as radically the same woman who had engaged herself to many him in the
      summer. To him she was still the beautiful shrew whose taming appealed to
      masculine instincts. The brown hair sweeping up in a wave from the
      forehead, the finely chiselled sensitive features, the clear brown eyes,
      the mocking lips, the superb poise of the head, the stately figure
      perfectly set off in the dark blue tailor-made dress, all combined to
      impress him with a realisation of the queenliness of the presence that had
      grown somewhat shadowy of late to his unimaginative mental vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you like Parliament?&rdquo; she asked casually, when the teacup had
      been brought and handed to him filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find it remarkably interesting,&rdquo; he replied sententiously. &ldquo;It is dull
      at times, of course, but no man can sit on those green benches and not
      feel he is helping to shape the destinies of a colossal Empire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you really feel&mdash;or is it what you say when you are
      responding for the House of Commons at a public dinner?&rdquo; asked Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland hesitated for a moment between huffiness and indulgence. In spite
      of his former gibes at the stale unprofitableness of parliamentary life,
      he had always had the stolid Briton's reverence for our Institutions, and
      now that he was actually a legislator, his traditions led him to take
      himself seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have become a very keen politician, I assure you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If you
      saw the amount of work that falls on me, you would be astonished. If it
      were n't for Manisty&mdash;that's my secretary, you know&mdash;I don't see
      how I could get through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always wonder,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, &ldquo;how members manage to find time
      for anything. They work like galley-slaves for nothing at all. I regard
      them as simply sacrificing themselves for the public good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A member of Parliament is the noblest work of God. Don't, mother. Please
      leave us our illusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; asked Morland.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;One is that there are a few decently
      selfish people left in an age of altruists,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked for the sake of talking, careless of the stupid poverty of her
      epigram. Morland, as the healthy country gentleman alternating with the
      commonplace man about town, was a passable type enough, though failing to
      excite exuberant admiration. But Morland, with his narrow range of
      sympathies and pathetic ignorance of the thought of the day, posing
      solemnly as a trustee of the British Empire, aroused a scorn which she
      dare not express in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that we are all altruists,&rdquo; replied Morland,
      good-temperedly. &ldquo;If we are good little members of Parliament, we may be
      rewarded with baronetcies and things. But one has to play the game
      thoroughly. It's worth it, is n't it, even from your point of view,
      Norma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're just the class of man the government does best in rewarding,&rdquo;
       remarked Mrs. Hardacre, with her wintry smile that was meant to be
      conciliatory. &ldquo;A man of birth and position upholds the dignity of a title
      and is a credit to his party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland laughingly observed that it was early in the day to be thinking of
      parliamentary honours. He had not even made his maiden speech. As Norma
      remained silent, the conversation languished. Presently Mrs. Hardacre
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt you two want to have a talk together. Won't you stay and
      dine with us, Morland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Norma, but failing to read an endorsement of the invitation
      in her face, made an excuse for declining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will say good-bye and leave you. I would n't stand any nonsense if
      I were you,&rdquo; she added in a whisper through the door which he held open
      for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sauntered up to the fireplace and stood on the hearth-rug, his hands in
      his pockets. Norma, looking at him from her easy-chair, wondered at a
      certain ignobility that she detected for the first time beneath his bluff,
      prosperous air. In spite of birth and breeding he looked common.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We had better have it out at once. What is it to be? I
      must have an answer sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't it be later?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you insist upon it. I'm not going to hold a pistol to your head, my
      dear girl. Only you must admit that I've treated you with every
      consideration. I have n't worried you. You took it into your head to put
      off our marriage. I felt you had your reasons and I raised no objection.
      But we can't go on like this forever, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human nature. I am in love with you, and want to marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing I am not in love with you, Morland. I've never pretended to
      be, have I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need n't go over old ground. I accepted all that at the beginning. The
      present state of affairs is that we are engaged; when are we going to be
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; said Norma, desperately. &ldquo;I have n't thought of it
      seriously. I know I have behaved like a beast to you&mdash;you must
      forgive me. At times it has seemed as though I was not the right sort to
      marry and bring children into the world. I should loathe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't think so,&rdquo; said Morland, in a tone he meant to be soothing.
      &ldquo;Besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you are going to say&mdash;or at any rate what you would like
      to say. It's scarcely decent to talk of such things. But I have n't been
      brought up in a nunnery. I wish to God I had been. At all events, I am
      frank. I would loathe it&mdash;all that side of it. Could n't we suppress
      that side? Oh, yes, I am going to speak of it&mdash;it has been on my mind
      for months,&rdquo; she burst out, as Morland made a quick step towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not allow her to continue. With his hand on the arm of her chair,
      he bent down over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are talking wild nonsense,&rdquo; he said; and she flushed red and did not
      meet his eyes. &ldquo;When a man marries, he marries in the proper sense of the
      term, unless he is an outrageous imbecile. There is to be no question of
      that sort of thing. I thought you knew your world better. I want you&mdash;you
      yourself. Don't you understand that?&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
Norma put out her hand to push him
      away. He seized it in his. She snatched it from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get up,&rdquo; she said, waving him off. She brushed past him, as she
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't go on talking. What I've said has made it impossible. Let us
      change the subject. How long are you going to stay in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to change the subject,&rdquo; said Morland, rather brutally. &ldquo;I'm
      far too much interested in it. Hang it all, Norma, you do owe me
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I owe you? What?&rdquo; she asked with a sudden flash in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a woman of common-sense. I leave you to guess. You admit you have
      n't treated me properly. You have nothing to complain of as far as I am
      concerned. Now, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? No. I suppose not, as things go. Once I did try to&mdash;to
      feel more like other women&mdash;and to make some amends. I told you that
      perhaps we were making a mistake in excluding sentiment. If you had
      chosen, you could have&mdash;I don't know&mdash;made me care for you,
      perhaps. But you didn't choose. You treated me as if I were a fool. Very
      likely I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo; asked Morland, with a touch of sarcasm. &ldquo;I certainly
      don't remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the last night we had any talk together&mdash;in the
      billiard-room. The night before&mdash;before the garden-party.&rdquo; He turned
      away with an involuntary exclamation of anger. He remembered now, tragic
      events having put the incident out of his mind. He was caught in a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't think you meant it,&rdquo; he said, hurrying to the base excuse.
      &ldquo;Women sometimes consider it their duty to say such things&mdash;to act a
      little comedy, out of kindness. Some fellows expect it. I thought it would
      be more decent to let you see that I did n't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence. Norma stood in the centre of the room, biting
      her lip, her head moving slightly from side to side; she was seeking to
      formulate her thoughts in conventional terms. Her cheek grew a shade
      paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said at length. &ldquo;I am anything bad you like to call me. But
      I'm not a woman who cajoles men. And I'm not a liar. I'm far too cynical
      to lie. Truth is much more deadly. I hate lying. That's the main reason
      why I broke with a man I cared for more than for any other man I have ever
      met&mdash;because he lied. You know whom I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He faced her with a conscious effort. Even at this moment of strain and
      anger, Norma was struck again with the lurking air of ignobility on his
      face; but she only remembered it afterwards. He brazened it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie Padgate, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't forgive him for lying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how he lied. He faced the music, at any rate, like a man,&rdquo;
       said Morland, compelled by a remnant of common decency to defend Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All his pose beforehand was a lie&mdash;unless the disclosures afterwards
      were lies&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Morland, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind. We have not met to discuss the matter. I don't know why I
      referred to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a moment. She had begun her tirade at a white heat.
      Suddenly she had cooled down, and felt lassitude in mind and limbs. An
      effort brought her to a lame conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accused me of acting a comedy. I was n't acting. I was perfectly
      sincere. I have been absolutely frank with you from the hour you proposed
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm sorry for having misunderstood you. I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said
      Morland. They took up the conversation from the starting-point, but
      listlessly, dispiritedly. The reference to Jimmie had awakened the
      ever-living remorse in Morland's not entirely callous soul. The man did
      suffer, at times acutely. And now to act the conscious comedy in the face
      of Norma's expressed abhorrence was a difficult and tiring task.
      Unwittingly he grew gentler; and Norma, her anger spent, weakly yielded to
      the change of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have settled nothing, after all our talk,&rdquo; he said at last, looking at
      his watch. &ldquo;Don't you think we had better fix it up now? Society expects
      us to get married. What will people say? Come&mdash;what about Easter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma passed her hand wearily over her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I oughtn't to marry you at all. I should loathe it, as I said. I should
      never get to care for you in that way. You see I am honest. Let us break
      off the engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look here,&rdquo; said Morland, not unkindly, &ldquo;let us compromise. I'll
      come back in three days' time. You'll either say it's off altogether or
      we'll be married at Easter. Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Hardacre came for news of the interview, Norma told her of the
      arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is it going to be?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma set her teeth. &ldquo;I can't marry him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the proud spirit of Norma Hardacre was broken. The three days' Inferno
      that Mrs. Hardacre created in the house drove the girl to desperation. Her
      father came to her one day with the tears running down his puffy cheeks.
      Unknown to her mother he had borrowed money from Morland, which he had
      lost on the Stock Exchange. Norma looked in her mirror, and found herself
      old, ugly, hag-ridden. Anything was preferable to the torture and
      degradation of her home. The next time that Morland called he stayed to
      dinner, and the wedding was definitely fixed for Easter.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIX&mdash;ABANA AND PHARPAR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>o you know, Miss
      Hardacre, that I once had a wife?&rdquo; said Theodore Weever, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after dinner at the Wolff-Salamons', who, it may be remembered, had
      lent their house to the Hardacres in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware of it,&rdquo; said Norma, wondering at the irrelevance of the
      remark, for they had just been discussing the great painter's merciless
      portrait of their hostess, which simpered vulgarly at them from the wall.
      They were sitting on a sofa in a corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Weever. &ldquo;She died young. She came from a New England village,
      and played old-fashioned tunes on the piano, and believed in God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a flicker passed over his smooth waxen face or a gleam of sentiment
      appeared in his pale steady eyes. Norma glanced round at the little
      assembly, mainly composed of fleshy company promoters, who, as far as
      decency allowed, continued among themselves the conversation that had
      circulated over the wine downstairs, and their women-kind, who adopted the
      slangy manners of smart society and talked &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; to such men as would
      listen to them. Then she glanced back at Weever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any more wives of that sort,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I've outgrown
      them. I have no use for them. They would wilt like a snow anemone in this
      kind of atmosphere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your favourite atmosphere, then?&rdquo; Norma asked, by way of saying
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More or less. Perhaps I like it not quite so mephitic&mdash;You are
      racking your brains to know why I'm telling you about my wife. I'll
      explain. In a little churchyard in Connecticut is a coffin, and in that
      coffin is what a man who is going to ask a woman to marry him ought to
      give her. I could never give a quiet-eyed New England girl anything again.
      At my age she would bore me to death. But I could give the woman who is
      accustomed to hot-houses a perfectly regulated temperature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma looked at the imperturbable face, half touched by his unsuspected
      humanity, half angered by his assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you by any chance making me a formal demand in marriage?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at last you have found some one who would meet your requirements for
      the decorative wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found her last summer in Scotland,&rdquo; replied Weever, with a little bow.
      &ldquo;My countrymen have a habit of finding quickly what they want. They
      generally get it. I could n't in this particular instance, as you were
      engaged to another man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am still engaged,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I heard the engagement was broken off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. In fact only yesterday was it settled that we should be
      married at Easter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having gone so far on a false assumption,&rdquo; remarked Weever, placidly,
      &ldquo;may I go without rudeness a step farther? I do not dream of asking you to
      throw over King&mdash;if my heart were not in Connecticut, I might&mdash;but
      I'll say this, if you will allow me, Miss Hardacre: I don't believe you
      will ever marry Morland King. I have a presentiment that you're going to
      marry me&mdash;chiefly because I've planned it, and my plans mostly come
      out straight. Anyway you are the only woman in the world I should ever
      marry, and if at any time there should be a chance for me, a word, a hint,
      a message through the telephone to buy you a pug dog&mdash;or anything&mdash;would
      bring me devotedly to your feet. Don't forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to be angry with a bloodless thing that spoke like a
      machine. It was also unnecessary to use the conventional terms of
      regretful gratitude in which maidens in their mercy wrap refusals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll remember it with pleasure, if you like,&rdquo; she said with a half-smile.
      &ldquo;But tell me why you don't think I shall marry Mr. King. I don't believe
      in your presentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught his eye, and they remained for some seconds looking hard at
      each other. She saw that he had his well-defined reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell me exactly what is in your mind,&rdquo; she said slowly; &ldquo;you and
      I seem to understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you understand me, what is the use of compromising speech, my dear
      lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't believe in Morland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a statesman I can't say that I do,&rdquo; replied Weever, with the puckering
      of the faint lines round his eyes that passed for a smile. &ldquo;That is what
      astonishes me in your English political life&mdash;the little one need
      talk and the little one need do. In America the politician is the orator.
      He must move in an atmosphere of words half a mile thick. Wherever he goes
      he must scream himself hoarse. But here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma touched his arm with her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not discussing American and English institutions,&rdquo; she
      interrupted, &ldquo;but matters which interest me a little more. You don't
      believe in Morland as a man? I want to know, as they are supposed to say
      in your country. I disregard your hint, as you may perceive. I am also
      indelicate in pressing you to speak unfavourably of the man I'm engaged
      to. Of course, having made me an offer, you would regard it as caddish to
      say anything against him. But supposing I absolve you from anything of the
      kind by putting you on a peculiar plane of friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should say I was honoured above all mortals,&rdquo; replied Weever,
      inscrutably, &ldquo;and ask you to tell me as a friend what has become of the
      artist&mdash;the man who got shot&mdash;Padgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected allusion was a shock. It brought back a hateful scene. It
      awoke a multitude of feelings. Its relevance was a startling puzzle. She
      strove by hardening her eyes not to betray herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've quite lost sight of him,&rdquo; she answered in a matter of-fact tone.
      &ldquo;His little adventure was n't a pleasant one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe he had any little adventure at all,&rdquo; said Weever, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Norma started, and the colour came into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of all the idiots let loose in a cynical, unimaginative world,
      Padgate is the greatest I have yet struck. If I were a hundredth part such
      an idiot, I should be a better and a happier man. It's getting late. I'm
      afraid I must be moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and Norma rose with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would n't speak in riddles. Can't you tell me plainly what you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;I have said quite enough. Good-night.
      And remember,&rdquo; he added, shaking hands with her, &ldquo;remember what I told you
      about myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only after he had gone did it flash upon her that she had not put to him
      the vital question&mdash;what had Padgate to do with his disbelief in
      Morland? As is the way with people pondering over conundrums, the
      ridiculously simple solution did not occur to her. She spent many days in
      profitless speculation. Weever prophesied that the marriage would not take
      place. When pressed for a reason, he brought in the name of Jimmie
      Padgate. Obviously the latter was to stand between Morland and herself.
      But in what capacity? As a lover? Had Weever rightly interpreted her
      insane act on the day of the garden-party, and assumed that she was still
      in love with the detested creature? The thought made her grow hot and cold
      from head to foot. Why was he an idiot? Because he did not take advantage
      of her public confession? or was it because he stood in Weever's eyes as
      a wronged and heroic man? This in the depths of her heart she had been
      yearning for months to believe. Connie Deering almost believed it. About
      the facts once so brutally plain, so vulgarly devoid of mystery, a
      mysterious cloud had gathered and was thickening with time. Reflection
      brought assurance that Theodore Weever regarded Jimmie as innocent; and if
      ever a man viewed human affairs in the dry, relentless light of reason, it
      was the inscrutable, bloodless American.
    </p>
    <p>
      His offer of marriage she put aside from her thoughts. Morland was the
      irrevocably accepted. It was February. Easter falling early, the wedding
      would take place in a little over a month. In a cold, dispassionate way,
      she interested herself in the usual preparations. Peace reigned in
      Devonshire Place. And yet Norma despised herself, feeling the degradation
      of the woman who sells her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the session she saw little of Morland. For this she thanked God,
      the duchess, and the electors of Cosford. The sense of freedom caused her
      to repent of her contemptuous attitude towards his political aspirations.
      To encourage and foster them would be to her very great advantage. She
      adopted this policy, much to the edification of Morland, who felt the
      strengthening of a common bond of interest. He regularly balloted for
      seats in the Ladies' Gallery, and condemned her to sit for hours behind
      the grating and listen to uninspiring debates. He came to her with the
      gossip of the lobbies. He made plans for their future life together. They
      would make politics a feature of their house. It would be a rallying-place
      for the new Tory wing, in which Morland after a dinner at the Carlton Club
      when his health was proposed in flattering terms, had found himself
      enlisted. Norma was to bring back the glories of the <i>salon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it gets too thick,&rdquo; he said once laughingly, ashamed of these
      wanderings into the ideal, &ldquo;we can go off into the country and shoot and
      have some decent people down and amuse ourselves rationally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in spite of absorbing political toys, his complete subjugation of
      Norma, and the smiling aspect of life, a sense of utter wretchedness
      weighed upon the soul of this half-developed man. He could not shake it
      off. It haunted him as he sat stolid and stupefied in his place below the
      gangway. It dulled all sensation of pleasure when he kissed the lips which
      Norma, resigned now to everything, surrendered to him at his pleasure. It
      took the sparkle out of his champagne, the joy out of his life. Now that
      he had asserted himself as the victorious male who had won the female that
      he coveted, the sense of wrong inflicted on him grew less and the
      consciousness of his own shame grew greater. In his shallow way he had
      loved Jimmie dearly. He also had the well-bred Englishman's conventional
      sense of honour. Accusing conscience wrote him down an unutterable knave.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in March, as he was proceeding citywards to see his solicitors on
      some question relating to marriage settlements, his carriage was blocked
      for some minutes in Oxford Street. Looking idly out of the near side
      window, he saw a familiar figure emerge from a doorway in a narrow passage
      come down to the pavement, and stand for a few moments in anxious thought,
      jostled by the passers-by. He looked thin and ill and worried. The lines
      by the sides of his drooping moustache had deepened. Jimmie, never spruce
      in his attire, now seemed outrageously shabby. Certain men who dress well
      are quick, like women, to notice these things. Morland's keen glance took
      in the discoloured brown boots and the frayed hem of trousers, the weather
      stains on the old tweed suit, the greasiness of the red tie, the irregular
      mark of perspiration on the band of the old Homburg hat. An impulse to
      spring out of the carriage and greet him was struggling with sheer shame,
      when Jimmie suddenly threw up his head&mdash;an old trick of his whose
      familiarity brought a pang to the man watching him&mdash;and crossed the
      road, disappearing among the traffic behind the brougham. Morland gazed
      meditatively at the little passage. Suddenly he was aware of the three
      brass balls and the name of Attenborough. In a moment he was on the
      pavement and, after a hurried word to his coachman, in pursuit of Jimmie.
      But the traffic had swallowed Jimmie up. It was impossible to track him.
      Morland returned to his brougham and drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one explanation of what he had seen. Jimmie was reduced to
      poverty, to pawning his belongings in order to live. The scandal had
      killed the sale of his pictures. No more ladies would sit to him for their
      portraits. No more dealers would purchase works on the strength of his
      name. Jimmie was ill, poor, down at heel, and it was all his, Morland's,
      fault, his very grievous fault. In a dim, futile way he wished he were a
      Roman Catholic, so that he could go to a priest, confess, and receive
      absolution. The idea of confession obsessed him in this chastened mood. By
      lunch-time he had resolved to tell Norma everything and abide by her
      verdict. At any rate, if he married her, he would not do so under false
      pretences. He would feel happier with the load of lies off his mind. At
      half-past four he left the House of Commons to transact its business
      without him as best it could, and drove to Devonshire Place. As he neared
      the door, his courage began to fail. He remembered Norma's passionate
      outburst against lying, and shrank from the withering words that she might
      speak. The situation, however, had to be faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid who opened the front door informed him that Norma was out, but
      that Mrs. Hardacre was at home. He was shown upstairs into the empty
      drawing-room, and while he waited there, a solution of his difficulty
      occurred to him. He caught at it eagerly, as he had caught at compromises
      and palliatives all his life. For he was a man of half-sins, half-virtues,
      half-loves, and half-repentances. His spiritual attitude was that of
      Naaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre greeted him with smiles of welcome, and regrets at Norma's
      absence. If only he had sent a message, Norma would have given up her
      unimportant engagement. She would be greatly disappointed. The House took
      up so much of his time, and Norma prized the brief snatches she could
      obtain of his company. All of which, though obviously insincere, none the
      less flattered Morland's vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is as well that Norma is away,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I want to have a
      little talk with you. Can you give me five minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty, my dear Morland,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Hardacre, graciously. &ldquo;Will you
      have some tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He declined. It was too serious a matter for the accompaniment of
      clattering teaspoons. Mrs. Hardacre sat in an armchair with her back to
      the light&mdash;the curtains had not yet been drawn&mdash;and Morland sat
      near her, looking at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something on my mind,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You, as Norma's mother, ought to
      know. It's about my friend Jimmie Padgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre put out a lean hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather not hear it. I'm not uncharitable, but I wish none of us
      had ever set eyes on the man. He came near ruining us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have ruined himself. He's ill, poor, in dreadful low water. I
      caught a sight of him this morning. The poor old chap was almost in rags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very unpleasant for Mr. Padgate, but it fails to strike me as
      pathetic. He has only got his deserts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where the point lies,&rdquo; said Morland. &ldquo;He does n't deserve it. I
      do. I am the only person to blame in the whole infernal business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hardacre, her grey eyes glittering with sudden interest.
      &ldquo;What had you to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, everything. Jimmie never set eyes on the girl in his life. He took
      all the blame to shield me. If he had n't done so, there would have been
      the devil to pay. That's how it stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre gave a little gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Morland, you amaze me. You positively shock me. Really, don't you
      think in mentioning the matter to me there is some&mdash;indelicacy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a woman of the world,&rdquo; said Morland, bluntly, &ldquo;and you know that
      men don't lead the lives of monks just because they happen to be
      unmarried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, composing herself to sweetness.
      &ldquo;One knows many things of which it is hardly necessary or desirable to
      talk. Of course I think it shocking and disreputable of you. But it's all
      over and done with. If that was on your mind, wipe it off and let us say
      no more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you don't understand,&rdquo; said Morland, rising and leaning
      against the mantel-piece. &ldquo;What is done is done. Meanwhile another man is
      suffering for it, while I go about prospering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely that is a matter between Mr. Padgate and yourself. How can it
      possibly concern us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Morland had not looked at the case from that point of view, he silently
      inspected it with a puzzled brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help feeling a bit of a brute, you know,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;I
      meant at first to let him off&mdash;to make a clean breast of it&mdash;but
      it wasn't feasible. You know how difficult these things are when they get
      put off. Then, of course, I thought I could make it up to Jimmie in other
      ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so you can,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, with the elaborate pretence of a
      little yawn, as if the subject had ceased to interest her. &ldquo;You could
      afford it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money is no good. He won't touch a penny. I have offered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear Morland, you have done your best. If a man is idiot enough
      to saddle himself with other people's responsibilities and refuses to be
      helped when he breaks down under them, you must let him go his own way.
      Really I haven't got any sympathy for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland, having warmed himself sufficiently and feeling curiously
      comforted by Mrs. Hardacre's wise words, sat down again near her and leant
      forward with his arms on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Norma would take the same view?&rdquo; he asked. After all, in
      spite of certain eccentricities inseparable from an unbalanced sex, she
      had as much fundamental common-sense as her mother. The latter looked at
      him sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Norma got to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering whether I ought to tell her,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre started bolt upright in her chair. This time her interest
      was genuine. Nothing but her long training in a world of petty strife kept
      the sudden fright out of her eyes and voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Norma? Whatever for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would be more decent,&rdquo; said Morland, rather feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be sheer lunacy!&rdquo; cried the lady, appalled at the certain
      catastrophe that such a proceeding would cause. Did not the demented
      creature see that the whole affair was in unstable equilibrium? A touch,
      let alone a shock like this, would bring it toppling down, never to be set
      up again by any prayers, remonstrances, ravings, curses, thumbscrews, or
      racks the ingenuity of an outraged mother could devise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be utter imbecility,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;My dear man, don't you
      think one mad Don Quixote in a romance is enough? What on earth would you,
      Norma, or any one else gain by telling her? She is as happy as possible
      now, buying her trousseau and making all the wedding arrangements. Why
      spoil her happiness? I think it exceedingly inconsiderate of you&mdash;not
      to say selfish&mdash;I do really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly that. It was an idea of doing penance,&rdquo; said Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, relaxing into a bantering tone, as
      she joyfully noted the lack of conviction in his manner, &ldquo;I'll make you a
      hair shirt, and I'll promise it shall be scratchy&mdash;untanned pigskin
      with the bristles on, if you like. Be as uncomfortable, my dear Morland,
      as ever you choose&mdash;wear a frock-coat with a bowler hat or dine <i>tête-à-tête</i>
      with Mr. Hardacre, but do leave other folks to pass their lives in peace
      and quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland threw himself back and laughed, and Mrs. Hardacre knew she had won
      what she paradoxically called a moral victory. They discussed the question
      for a few moments longer, and then Morland rose to take his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's awfully good of you to look at things in this broadminded way,&rdquo; he
      said, with the air of a man whom an indulgent lady has pardoned for a
      small peccadillo. &ldquo;Awfully good of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no other sane way of looking at them,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Hardacre.
      &ldquo;Won't you wait and see Norma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get back to the House,&rdquo; replied Morland, consulting his watch.
      &ldquo;There may be a division before the dinner-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smoked a great cigar on his way to Westminster, and enjoyed it
      thoroughly. Mrs. Hardacre was quite right. He had done his best. If Jimmie
      was too high and mighty to accept the only compensation possible, he was
      not to blame. The matter was over and done with. It would be idiotic to
      tell Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, having made confession and received absolution, he felt
      spiritually refreshed.

      Chapter XX&mdash;ALINE PREPARES FOR BATTLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE look of illness
      that Morland had noticed upon Jimmie's face was due to the fact that he
      had been ill. Italian townlets nestling on hillsides are picturesque, but
      they are not always healthy. A touch of fever had laid him on his back for
      a week, and caused the local doctor to order him to England. He had
      arrived in a limp condition, much to the anxiety of Aline, who had
      expected to see the roses return to his cheek as soon as their slender
      baggage had passed the custom-house. He was shabbily dressed because he
      had fallen on evil times, and had no money to waste on personal vanities.
      The four guineas which Aline had put aside out of their limited resources
      to buy him a new suit he had meanly abstracted from the housekeeping
      drawer, and had devoted, with the surreptitious help of the servant, to
      purchasing necessary articles of attire for Aline. He was looking worried
      because he had forgotten in which of the cheap Oxford Street restaurants
      he had promised to meet that young lady. When he remembered, the cloud
      passed from his face and he darted across the road behind Morland's
      brougham. He found Aline seated primly at a little marble table on which
      were a glass of milk and a lump of amorphous pastry for herself, and a
      plate of cold beef and a small bottle of Bass for Jimmie. It was too early
      for the regular crowd of lunchers&mdash;only half-past twelve&mdash;and
      the slim, erect little figure looked oddly alone in the almost empty
      restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie nodded in a general, kindly way at the idle waitresses about the
      buffet, and marched down the room with a quick step, his eyes beaming. He
      sat down with some clatter opposite Aline, and took two cheques, a
      bank-note and a handful of gold and silver from his pocket, and dumped
      them noisily on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, my child. Seven pounds ten. Twenty-five guineas. Five pounds. And
      eight pounds three-and-six-pence. Exit wolf at the door, howling, with his
      tail between his legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline looked at the wealth with knitted brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I take this?&rdquo; she asked, lifting up the five-pound note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie pushed the pile towards her. &ldquo;Take it all, my dear. What on earth
      should I do with it? Besides, it's all your doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I made you go and dun those horrid dealers? And even now Hyam has
      only given you half. It was fifty guineas&mdash;Oh, Jimmie! Do you mean to
      say you forgot? Now, what did you tell him? Did you produce the
      agreement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie looked at her ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I forgot the wretched agreement. I went in and twirled my
      moustache fiercely, and said 'Mr. Hyam, I want my money.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline laughed. &ldquo;And you took him by the throat. I know. Oh, you foolish
      person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he asked me if twenty-five would be enough&mdash;and it's a lot of
      money, you know, dear&mdash;and I thought if I did n't say 'yes,' he would
      n't give me anything. In business affairs one has to be diplomatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to take Hyam in hand myself,&rdquo; said Aline, decisively. &ldquo;Well,
      he'll have to pay up some day. Then there's Blathwayt &amp; Co.,&mdash;and
      Tilney&mdash;that's quite right&mdash;but where did you get all that gold
      from, Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was somebody else,&rdquo; he said vaguely. Then turning to the
      waitress, who had sauntered up to open the bottle of Bass, he pointed at
      Aline's lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind taking away that eccentric pie-thing and bringing the most
      nutritious dish you have in the establishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Jimmie, this is a Bath bun. It's delicious,&rdquo; protested Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, growing girls cannot be fed like bears on buns. Ah, here,&rdquo;
       he said to the waitress who showed him the little wooden-handled frame
      containing the tariff, &ldquo;bring this young lady some galantine of chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline, who in her secret heart loved the &ldquo;eccentric pie-thing&rdquo; beyond all
      other dainties, and trembled at the stupendous charge, possibly ninepence
      or a shilling, that would be made for the galantine, yielded, after the
      manner of women, because she knew it would please Jimmie. But accustomed
      to his diplomatic methods, she felt that a red herring&mdash;or a
      galantine&mdash;had been drawn across the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the somebody else?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and drank a draught of beer and wiped the froth from his
      moustache. Something unusual in his personal appearance suddenly caught
      her attention. His watch-chain was dangling loose from the buttonhole of
      his waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your watch!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dissimulation being vain, Jimmie confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me this morning, my dear, that if we didn't get fifty pounds
      to-day we were ruined. You spoke alarmingly of the workhouse. My debt
      collecting amounted to thirty-eight pounds fifteen. I tried hard to work
      the obdurate bosom up to eleven pounds five, but he would only give me
      eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say you have sold your beautiful gold watch for eight
      pounds?&rdquo; cried the girl, turning as pale as the milk in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a present from a wealthy stockbroker who had been delighted
      with his portrait painted by Jimmie a couple of years ago, and it was
      thick and heavy and the pride of Aline's existence. It invested Jimmie
      with an air of solidity, worldly substantiality; and it was the only
      timekeeper they had ever had in the house which properly executed its
      functions. Now he had sold it! Was there ever so exasperating a man? He
      was worse than Moses with his green spectacles. But Jimmie reassured her.
      He had only pawned the watch at Attenborough's over the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give me the ticket, do, or you'll lose it, Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meekly obeyed. Aline began her galantine with a sigh of relief, and
      condescended to laugh at Jimmie's account of his exploits. But when the
      meal was ended, she insisted on redeeming the precious watch, and much
      happier in knowing it safe in his pocket, she carried him off to a
      ready-made tailor's, where she ordered him a beautiful thin overcoat for
      thirty shillings, a neat blue serge suit for three pounds ten, handing
      over in payment the five-pound note she had abstracted from his gleanings,
      and a new hat, for which she paid from a mysterious private store of her
      own. These matters having been arranged to her satisfaction, she made up
      for her hectoring ways by nestling against him on top of the
      homeward-bound omnibus and telling him what a delightful, lovely morning
      they had spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it will be seen that Jimmie, aided by Aline's stout little heart, was
      battling more than usual against adversity. Aline had many schemes. Why
      should she not obtain some lucrative employment? Jimmie made a wry face at
      the phrase and protested vehemently against the suggestion. A hulking
      varlet like him to let her wear her fingers to the bone by addressing
      envelopes at twopence a million? He would sooner return to the
      five-shillings-a-dozen oil paintings; he would go round the streets at
      dawn and play &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; to pavement artists; he would take in washing! The
      idea of the street-pictures caught his fancy. He expatiated upon its
      advantages. Five pitches, say at two shillings a pitch, that would be ten
      shillings a day&mdash;three pounds a week. A most business-like plan, to
      say nothing of the education in art it would be to the public! He had his
      own fantastical way of dealing with the petty cares of life. As for Aline
      working, he would not hear of it. Though they lived now from hand to
      mouth, they were always fed. He had faith in the ravens.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the fantasy and the faith could not subdue Aline's passionate
      rebellion against Jimmie's ostracism. She was very young, very feminine;
      she had not his wide outlook, his generous sympathies, his disdain of
      trivial, ignoble things, his independence of soul. The world was arrayed
      against Jimmie. Society was persecuting him with monstrous injustice. She
      hated his oppressors, longed fiercely for an opportunity of vindicating
      his honour. It was sometimes more than she could bear&mdash;to think of
      his straitened means, the absence of sitters, the lowered prices he
      obtained, the hours of unremitting toil he spent at his easel and
      drawing-table. During their travels she had not realised what the scandal
      would mean to him professionally. Now her heart rose in hot revolt and
      thirsted for battle in Jimmie's cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart had never been hotter than one morning when, the gem of his
      finished Italian studies having been rejected by the committee of a minor
      exhibition, she went down to the studio to give vent to her indignation.
      At breakfast Jimmie had laughed and kissed her and told her not to drop
      tears into his coffee. He would send the picture to the Academy, where it
      would be hung on the line and make him famous. He refused to be
      downhearted and talked buoyantly of other things. But Aline felt that it
      was only for her sake that he hid his bitter disappointment, and an hour
      later she could bear the strain of silence no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the studio was open. The girl's footstep was soft, and, not
      hearing it, he did not turn as she entered. For a few seconds she stood
      watching him; feeling shy, embarrassed, an intruder upon unexpected sacred
      things. Jimmie's mind was far away from minor exhibitions. He was sitting
      on his painting-stool, chin in hand, looking at a picture on the easel. On
      his face was unutterable pain, in his eyes an agony of longing. Aline
      caught her breath, frightened at the revelation. The eyes of the painted
      Norma smiled steadfastly into his. The horrible irony of it smote the
      girl. Another catch at the breath became a choking sob. Jimmie started,
      and as if a magic hand had passed across his features, the pain vanished,
      and Aline saw the homely face again with its look of wistful kindness.
      Overwrought, she broke into a passion of weeping. Jimmie put his arms
      about her and soothed her. What did the rejection of a picture matter? It
      was part of the game of painting. She must be his own brave little girl
      and smile at the rubs of fortune. But Aline shook the head buried on his
      shoulder, and stretched out a hand blindly towards the portrait. &ldquo;It's
      that. I can't bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An impossible thought shot through him. He drew away from her and caught
      her wrists somewhat roughly, and tried to look at her; but she bowed her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, my child?&rdquo; he asked curtly, with bent brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women are lightning-witted in their interpretation of such questions. The
      blood flooded her face, and her tears dried suddenly and she met his
      glance straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I'm jealous? Do you suppose I have n't known? I can't bear
      you to suffer. I can't bear her not to believe in you. I can't bear her
      not to love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie let go her wrists and stood before her full of grateful tenderness,
      quite at a loss for words. He looked whimsically at the flushed, defiant
      little face; he shook her by the shoulder and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My valiant tin soldier,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an old name for her, dating from nursery days, when they thought
      and talked according to the gospel of Hans Christian Andersen.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more passed between them. But thenceforward
      Jimmie put the finishing touches to the portrait openly, Instead of
      painting at it when he knew he should be undisturbed. The wedding was
      drawing near. The date had been announced in the papers, and Jimmie had
      put a cross against it in his diary. If only Norma would accept the
      portrait as a wedding-present, he would feel happier. But how to approach
      her he did not know. In her pure eyes, he was well aware, he must appear
      the basest of men, and things proceeding from him would bear a taint of
      the unspeakable. Yet he hungered for her acceptance. It was the most
      perfect picture he had painted or could ever paint. The divinest part of
      him had gone to the making of it. It held in its passionate simplicity the
      man's soul, as the Monna Lisa in its mysterious complexity holds
      Leonardo's. Of material symbols of things spiritual he could not give her
      more. But how to give?
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie Deering settled the question by coming to the studio one morning, a
      bewildering vision of millinery and smiles and kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have persistently refused, you wicked bear, to come and see me since
      my return to London, so I have no choice but to walk into your den. If it
      had n't been for Aline, beyond an occasional 'Dear Connie, I am very well.
      The weather is unusually warm for the time of year. Yours sincerely, J.
      P.', I should n't know whether you were alive or dead. I hope you're
      ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the little lady's exordium, to which she tactfully gave Jimmie no
      time to reply. She stayed for an hour. The disastrous topic was avoided.
      But Jimmie felt that she forbore to judge him for his supposed offence,
      and learned to his great happiness that Norma had asked after his welfare,
      and would without doubt deign in her divine graciousness to accept the
      portrait. She looked thoughtfully at the picture for some time, and then
      laid a light touch on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you must love her, Jimmie!&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;I have n't
      forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; he answered gravely. &ldquo;I oughtn't to have said what I
      did. I don't remember what I did say. I lost my head and raved. Every man
      has his hour of madness, and that was mine&mdash;all through your
      witchery. And yet somehow it seemed as if I were pouring it all out to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie Deering perceptibly winced. Plucking up courage, she began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish a man would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Connie,&rdquo; Jimmie interrupted kindly, &ldquo;there are hundreds of men in
      London who are sighing themselves hoarse for you. But you are such a
      hard-hearted butterfly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips twitched. &ldquo;Not so hard-hearted as you think, my good Jimmie,&rdquo; she
      retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she was all inconsequence and jest. On parting he took both
      her white-gloved little hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't realise the joy it has been to me to see you, Connie,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;It has been like a ray of sunlight through prison bars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a private talk with Aline she drove straight to Devonshire Place,
      and on the way dabbed her eyes with the inconsiderable bit of chiffon
      called a handkerchief which she carried in her gold chain purse. She saw
      Norma alone for a moment before lunch, and told her of her visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what he has done,&rdquo; she declared desperately. &ldquo;I am not going
      to let it make a difference any longer. He's the same dear creature I have
      known all my life, and I don't believe he has done anything at all. If
      there's a sinner in that horrible business, it is n't Jimmie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma looked out of the window at the bleak March day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what Theodore Weever said,&rdquo; she answered tonelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't you give Jimmie the benefit of the doubt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better that I should n't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a sweet little soul, Connie,&rdquo; said Norma, her eyes still fixed on
      the grey sky. &ldquo;But you may do more harm than good. I am better as I am. I
      have benumbed myself into a decent state of insensibility and I don't want
      to feel anything ever again as long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and Mrs. Hardacre appeared on the threshold. Connie bent
      forward and whispered quickly into Norma's ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think you were afraid to believe in Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swung round, flushed, femininely excited at having seized the unfair
      moment for dealing a stab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I <i>have</i> made her feel,&rdquo; she thought, as she fluttered
      forward to greet Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      She succeeded perhaps beyond her hope. A sharp glance showed her Norma
      still staring out of window, but staring now with an odd look of fear and
      pain. Her kind heart repented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me if I hurt you,&rdquo; she said on their way downstairs to lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; Norma answered by way of pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the shrewd thrust mattered exceedingly. After Connie had gone, the
      wound ached, and Norma found that her boast of having benumbed herself was
      a vain word. In the night she lay awake, frightened at the reaction that
      was taking place. Theodore Weever had shaken her more than she had
      realised. Connie Deering proclaimed the same faith. She felt that she too
      would have to accept it&mdash;against argument, against reason, against
      fact. She would have to accept it wholly, implicitly; and she dreaded the
      act of faith. Her marriage with Morland was fixed for that day week, and
      she was agonisingly aware that she loved another man with all her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she received a hurried note from Connie Deering:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Do come in for half an hour for tea on Sunday. I have a beautiful
      wedding-present to show you which I hope you'll like, as great pains have
      been spent over it. And I want to have a last little chat with you.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      She promised unreflectingly, seeing no snare. But as she walked to
      Bryanston Square on Sunday afternoon, more of a presentiment, a foreboding
      of evil, than a suspicion fixed itself upon her mind, and she wished she
      had not agreed to come. She was shown into the drawing-room, and there,
      beside a gilt-framed picture over which a cloth was thrown, with her great
      brown eyes meeting her defiantly, stood Aline.

      Chapter XXI&mdash;THE MOTH MEETS THE STAR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HUS had Aline, her
      heart hot for battle in Jimmie's cause, contrived with Connie Deering as
      subsidiary conspirator. She had lain awake most of the night, thinking of
      the approaching interview, composing speeches, elaborating arguments,
      defining her attitude. Her plan of campaign was based on the assumption of
      immediate hostilities. She had pictured a scornful lady moved to sudden
      anger at seeing herself trapped, and haughtily refusing to discuss
      overtures of peace. It was to be war from the first, until she had brought
      her adversary low; and when the door-handle rattled and the door opened to
      admit Norma, every nerve in her young body grew tense, and her heart beat
      like the clapper of a bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma entered, looked for a moment in smiling surprise at Aline, came
      quickly forward, and moved by a sudden impulse, a yearning for love,
      sweetness, freshness, peace&mdash;she knew not what&mdash;she put her arms
      round the girl and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Aline, how sweet it is to see you again!&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
The poor little girl
      stood helpless. The bottom was knocked out of her half-childish plan of
      campaign. There was no scornful lady, no haughty words, no hostilities.
      She fell to crying. What else could she do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there! Don't cry, dear,&rdquo; said Norma soothingly, almost as
      helpless. Seating herself on a low chair and drawing Aline to her side,
      she looked up at the piteous face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you cry, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't know you would be so good to me,&rdquo; answered Aline, wiping her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should n't I be good to you? What reason could I have for not being
      glad to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said the girl, with a touch of bitterness. &ldquo;Things are so
      different now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma sighed for answer and thought of her premonition. She was aware that
      Connie had deliberately planned this interview, but could find no
      resentment in her heart. The reproach implied in Aline's words she
      accepted humbly. She was at once too spiritless for anger, and too much
      excited by the girl's presence for regret at having come. Her eye fell
      upon the picture leaning against the chair-back, and a conjecture swiftly
      passed through her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Deering asked me to come and look at a wedding-present,&rdquo; she said
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she tell you from whom?&rdquo; asked Aline, thrusting her handkerchief into
      her pocket. She had found her nerve again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's from Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it that over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline caught and misinterpreted an unsteadiness of voice. She threw
      herself on her knees by Norma's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't refuse it, Miss Hardacre. Oh, say you won't refuse it. Jimmie
      began it ever so long ago. He put everything into it. It would break his
      heart if you refused it&mdash;the heart of the best and beautifullest and
      tenderest and most wonderful man God ever made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma touched with her gloved fingers a wisp of hair straying over the
      girl's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he is all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? How do I know the sun shines and the rain falls? It's just
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have faith, my child,&rdquo; said Norma, oddly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't faith. It's knowledge. You all believe Jimmie has done something
      horrible. He has n't. I know he hasn't. He couldn't. He couldn't harm a
      living creature by word or deed. I know he never did it. If I had thought
      so for one moment, I should have loathed myself so that I would have gone
      out and killed myself. I know very little about it. I did n't read the
      newspapers&mdash;it's hideous&mdash;it's horrible&mdash;Jimmie would as
      soon think of torturing a child. It's not in his nature. He is all love
      and sweetness and chivalry. If you say he has taken the blame on himself
      for some great generous purpose&mdash;yes. That's Jimmie. That's Jimmie
      all over. It's cruel&mdash;it's monstrous for any one who knows him to
      think otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen from her knees half-way through her passionate speech, and
      moved about in front of Norma, wringing her hands. She ended in a sob and
      turned away. Norma lay back in her chair, pale and agitated. The cynical
      worldling with his piercing vision into men and the pure, ignorant child
      had arrived at the same conclusion, not after months of thought, but
      instantly, intuitively. She could make the girl no answer. Aline began
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could n't. You know he could n't. It's something glorious and
      beautiful he has done and not anything shameful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on, with little pauses, hurling her short, breathless sentences
      across the space that separated her from Norma, forgetful of everything
      save the wrong done to Jimmie. At last Norma rose and went to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, dear!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are some things I mustn't talk about. I
      daren't. You are too young to understand. Mr. Padgate has sent me a
      wedding-present. Tell him how gladly I accept it and how I shall value it.
      Let me see the picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline, her slight bosom still heaving with the after-storm of emotion,
      said nothing, but drew the cloth from the canvas. Norma started back
      in-surprise. She had not anticipated seeing her own portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it is beautiful!&rdquo; she cried involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;more than beautiful,&rdquo; said Aline, and mechanically she moved
      the chair into the full light of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma looked at the picture for a long time, stepped back and looked at
      herself in the mirror of the overmantel, and returned to the picture. And
      as she looked the soul behind the picture spoke to her. The message
      delivered, she glanced at Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not I, that woman. I wish to God it were.&rdquo; She put her hands up to
      her face, and took a step or two across the room, and repeated a little
      wildly, &ldquo;I wish to God it were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very, very like you,&rdquo; said Aline softly, recovering her girl's
      worship of the other's stately beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma caught her by the arm and pointed at the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the soul behind the picture had not spoken to Aline. There was love
      hovering around the pictured woman's lips; happy tenderness and trust and
      promise mingled in her eyes; in so far as the shadow of a flower-like
      woman's passion could strain her features, so were her features strained.
      Yet she looked out of the canvas a proud, queenly woman, capable of
      heroisms and lofty sacrifice. She was one who loved deeply and demanded
      love in return. She was warm of the flesh, infinitely pure of the spirit.
      The face was the face of Norma, but the soul was that of the dream-woman
      who had come and sat in the sitter's chair and communed with Jimmie as he
      painted her. And Norma heard her voice. It was an indictment of her life,
      a judgment and a sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you can't, dear,&rdquo; she said to Aline, regaining her balance.
      &ldquo;Tell him I shall prize it above all my wedding-gifts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked quietly, for a while about Jimmie's affairs, the pilgrimage
      through southern France and northern Italy, his illness, his work. His
      poverty Aline was too proud to mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my dear?&rdquo; asked Norma, kindly.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about yourself? You are not looking as happy as you were. My dear
      child,&rdquo; she said, bending forward earnestly, &ldquo;do you know that no one has
      ever come to me with their troubles in all my life&mdash;not once. I'm
      beginning to feel I should be happier if some one did. You have had yours&mdash;-I
      have heard just a little. You see we all have them and we might help each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no troubles, Miss Hardacre,&rdquo; said Aline, touched. &ldquo;You are going
      to be married in a week's time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Aline. &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she poured her disastrous little love-story into Norma's ears. It
      was a wonderful new comfort to the child, this tender magic of the womanly
      sympathy. Oh! she loved him, of course she loved him, and he loved her;
      that was the piteous part of it. If Miss Hardacre only knew what it was to
      have the heart-ache! It was dreadful. And there was no hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that all?&rdquo; asked Norma, when she had lowered the curtain on her
      tragedy. &ldquo;You are eating out your heart for him and won't see him just
      because he won't believe in Jimmie? Listen. I feel sure that he will soon
      believe in Jimmie. He must. And then you'll be entirely happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the girl's grateful arms suddenly flung themselves about her, Norma
      was further on the road to happiness than she had ever travelled before.
      She yielded herself to the moment's exquisite charm. Behind her whirled a
      tumult of longing, shame, struggling faith, nameless suspicion. Before her
      loomed a shivering dread. The actual moment was an isle of enchanted
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock on a table at the far end of the room chiming six brought her
      back to the workaday world. She must go home. Morland was coming to
      dinner; also one or two Cosford people, who had already arrived in town in
      view of the wedding. She would have to dress with some elaborateness. Her
      heart grew heavy and cold at the prospect of the dreary party. She rose,
      looked again at the picture in the fading light. Moved by the
      irresistible, she turned to Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see him&mdash;to thank him&mdash;before&mdash;-before
      Wednesday. Do you think he would come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline blushed guiltily. &ldquo;Jimmie is in the house now,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Downstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment irresolute, she looked vacantly into the girl's pleading
      eyes. An odd darkness encompassed her and she saw nothing. The
      announcement was a shock of crisis. Dimly she knew that she trod the brink
      of folly and peril. But she had been caught unawares, and she longed
      stupidly, achingly, for the sight of his face. The words of Aline, eager
      in defence of her beloved, seemed far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he does n't know you are here. He was to call for me at a
      quarter to six, and I heard the front door open a little while ago. I
      brought the picture in a cab, and he is under the impression that Mrs.
      Deering will ask you to&mdash;will do what I have done. Jimmie is
      perfectly innocent, Miss Hardacre. He had not the remotest idea I was to
      meet you&mdash;not the remotest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma recovered herself sufficiently to say with a faint smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this has been a conspiracy between you and Connie Deering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline caught consent in the tone, and ignored the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I send him up to you?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a girl's glad cry, a girl's impulsive kiss, and Norma was left
      alone in the room. She had yielded. In a few moments he would be with her&mdash;the
      man who had said, &ldquo;Her voice haunts me like music heard in sleep... I
      worship her like a Madonna... I love her as the man of hot blood loves a
      woman... My soul is a footstool for her to rest her feet upon,&rdquo; and other
      flaming words of unforgettable passion; the man for whom one instant of
      her life had been elemental sex; the man whose love had transfigured her
      on canvas into the wonder among women that she might have been; the man
      standing in a slough of infamy, whose rising vapours wreathed themselves
      into a halo about his head. She clenched her hands and set her teeth,
      wrestling with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! What kind of a fool am I becoming?&rdquo; she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Training, the habit of the mask, came to her aid. Jimmie, entering, saw
      only the royal lady who had looked kindly upon him in the golden September
      days. She came to meet him frankly, as one meets an old friend. A new
      vision revealed to her the heart that leapt into his eyes, as they rested
      upon her. Mistress of herself, she hardened her own, but smiled and spoke
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is great good fortune you have come, so that I can thank you,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;But how can I ever thank you&mdash;for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a small gift enough,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;Your acceptance is more than
      thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall prize it dearly. It is like nothing that can be bought. It is
      something out of yourself you are giving me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you look at it in that light,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am happy indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a common instinct they went up to the portrait and regarded it side
      by side. Conventional words passed. He enquired after Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have n't seen him for a long time?&rdquo; she asked hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been very lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had Aline&mdash;and Connie Deering&mdash;and my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they sufficient for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any human love a man gets he can make fill his life. It's like the grain
      of mustard-seed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma felt a thrill of admiration. Not a tone in his voice betrayed
      complaint, reproach, or bitterness. Instead, he sounded the note of
      thanksgiving for the love bestowed upon him, of faith in the perfect
      ordering of the world. She glanced at him, and felt that she had wronged
      him. No matter what was the solution of the mystery, she knew him to be a
      sweet-souled man, wonderfully steadfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old way,&rdquo; she replied with a smile, sitting down and motioning him
      to a chair beside her. &ldquo;Do you remember that we first met in this very
      room? You have not changed. Have I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;you were always beautiful, without and within. I
      told you that then, if you remember. Perhaps, now, you are a little truer
      to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; she asked, somewhat bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is the approach of your great happiness,&rdquo; blundered Jimmie, in
      perfect conviction. She was silent. &ldquo;It has been more to me than I can
      say,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to see you once again&mdash;as you are, before your
      marriage. I wish you many blessings&mdash;all that love can bring you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think love is necessary for married happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without it marriage must be a horror,&rdquo; said Jimmie. For a moment she was
      on the brink of harsh laughter. Did he sincerely believe she was in love
      with Morland? She could have hurled the question at him. Will checked the
      rising hysteria and turned it into other channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you never married? You must have loved somebody once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief to hurt him. The dusk was gathering in the room, and she
      could scarcely see his face. A Sunday stillness filled the quiet square
      outside. The hour had its dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My having loved a woman does not necessarily imply that I could have
      married her,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evasion irritated her mood, awoke a longing to make him speak. She
      drew her chair nearer, bent forward, so that the brim of her great hat
      almost brushed his forehead and the fragrance of her overspread him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember a picture you would n't show me in your studio? You
      called it a mad painter's dream. You said it was the Ideal Woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> said so,&rdquo; replied Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mine no longer to show you,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must have loved that woman very deeply.&rdquo; She was tempting him
      as she had tempted no man before, feeling a cruel, senseless joy in it.
      His voice vibrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I loved her infinitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was she like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like all the splendid flowers of the earth melted into one rose,&rdquo; said
      Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish some one had ever said that about me,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many must have thought it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be a happy woman to be loved by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By me? Who am I that I could bring happiness to a woman? I have never
      told her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Do you suppose you can love a woman without her
      knowing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way can the star be cognisant of the moth's desire?&rdquo; said Jimmie,
      going back to the refrain of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a moth and she a star! You are a man and she is but a trumpery bit of
      female flesh that on a word would throw herself into your arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jimmie, hoarsely. &ldquo;No, you don't know what you are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The temptation to goad him was irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all of us alike, all of us. Tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare n't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me who she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him full, with meaning in her eyes, which glowed like deep
      moons in the dusk. He brought all his courage into his glance. He was the
      master. She turned away her head in confusion, reading his love, his
      strength, his loyalty. A lesser man loving her would have thrown honour to
      the winds. A curious reverence of him filled her. She felt a small thing
      beside him. All doubts vanished forever. Her faith in him was as crystal
      clear as Aline's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to mention her name,&rdquo; he said after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma leaned back in her chair and passed her handkerchief across her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you do anything in the world she asked you?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would go through hell for her,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another span of silence, tense and painful. Jimmie broke it by
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you concern yourself about my fantastic affairs? They merely
      belong to dreamland&mdash;to the twilight and the stillness. They have no
      existence in the living world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought so, should I be sitting in the twilight and the stillness
      listening to you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Or even if I did, may I not enter into
      dreamland too for a few little minutes before the gates are closed to me
      forever? Why should you want to shut me out of it? Do you think much love
      has come my way? Yours are the only lips I have ever heard speak of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morland loves you,&rdquo; said Jimmie, tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. The electric light was switched on, showing two pale,
      passion-drawn faces, and Connie Deering brought her sweet gaiety into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had known you two were sitting in the dark like this, I should have
      come up earlier. Is n't it nice, Norma, to have Jimmie back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spell was broken. Norma gave an anxious look at the clock and fled,
      after hurried farewells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress of the house arched her pretty eyebrows as she returned to
      Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eh bien?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connie&mdash;&rdquo; He cleared his throat. &ldquo;You have kept my secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loyally,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done my best. God knows I have done my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, took up a book and began to turn the leaves idly. Connie
      knelt down before the fire and put on a fresh log. This done, she came to
      his side. He took her hand and looked up into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n't thanked you, Connie. I do with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him with an odd wistfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You once thanked me in a very pretty manner,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I
      deserve it again.&rdquo;

      Chapter XXII&mdash;CATASTROPHE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ONNIE DEERING was
      dining that Sunday evening with some friends at the Carlton, an engagement
      which had caused her to decline an invitation to the Hardacres'. The
      prospect, however, for once did not appeal to her pleasure-loving soul.
      She sighed as she stepped into her brougham, and wished as she drove along
      that she were sitting at home in the tea-gown and tranquillity harmonious
      with a subdued frame of mind. Problems worried her. What had passed
      between Norma and Jimmie? Ordinary delicacy had forbidden her questioning,
      and Jimmie had admitted her no further into his confidence. In that she
      was disappointed. When a sentimental woman asks for a kiss, she expects
      something more. She was also half ashamed of herself for asking him to
      kiss her. A waspish little voice within proclaimed that it was not so much
      for Jimmie's sake as for her own; that her lifelong fondness for Jimmie
      had unconsciously slid on to the rails that lead to absurdity. She drew
      her satin cloak tightly around her as if to suffocate the imp, and
      returned to her speculation. Something had happened&mdash;of that there
      was no doubt&mdash;something serious, agitating. It could be read on both
      their faces. Had she, who alone knew the hearts of each, done right in
      bringing them together? What had been her object? Even if a marriage
      between them had not been too ludicrous for contemplation, it would not
      have been fair towards her cousin Morland to encourage this intrigue. She
      vowed she had been a little fool to meddle with such gunpowdery matters.
      And yet she had acted in all innocence for Jimmie's sake. It was right for
      Norma to be friends with him again. It was monstrous he should suffer. If
      he could not marry the woman he loved, at least he could have the
      happiness of knowing himself no longer a blackened wretch in her eyes. But
      then, Norma had taken it into her head to love him too. Had she done
      right? Her thoughts flew round in a vicious circle of irritatingly small
      circumference, occasionally flying off on the tangent of the solicited
      kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person she met in the vestibule of the Carlton was Theodore
      Weever. They exchanged greetings, discovered they belonged to the same
      party. She had come across him frequently of late in the houses that Norma
      and herself had as common ground. In a general way she liked him; since
      Norma had told her of his view of the scandal, he had risen high in her
      estimation; but to-night he seemed to be a link in the drama that
      perplexed her, and she shrank from him, as from something uncanny. He sat
      next her at table. His first words were of Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was buying pictures yesterday from a friend of yours&mdash;Padgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her pleasure Connie forgot her nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he never told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could scarcely have had time unless he telephoned or telegraphed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was at my house this afternoon,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carefully peppered his oysters, then turned his imperturbable face
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was Miss Hardacre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; she cried, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was calling in Devonshire Place. Her mother told me. I am not
      necromantic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His swift uniting of the two names perturbed her. She swallowed her
      oysters unreflectingly, thus missing one of her little pleasures in life,
      for she adored oysters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which pictures did you buy?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one I coveted was not for sale. It was a portrait of Miss Hardacre. I
      don't think he meant me to see it, but I came upon him unawares. Have you
      seen it?&rdquo; They discussed the portrait for a while. Connie repeated her
      former question. Weever replied that he had bought the picture of the faun
      looking at the vision of things to come, and the rejected Italian study.
      Connie expressed her gladness. They contained Jimmie's best work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine,&rdquo; Weever admitted, &ldquo;but just failing in finish. Nothing like
      the portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval. Connie exchanged remarks with old Colonel Pawley,
      her right-hand neighbour, who expatiated on the impossibility of consuming
      Bortsch soup with satisfaction outside Russia. The soup removed, Weever
      resumed the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read your Lamartine thoroughly? I have. I was sentimental once.
      He says somewhere, <i>Aimer pour être aimé, c'est de l'homme; mais aimer
      pour aimer, c'est presque de l'ange</i>. I remember where it comes from. It
      was said of Cecco in 'Graziella.' Our friend Padgate reminds me of Cecco.
      Do you care much about your cousin Morland King, Mrs. Deering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie, entirely disconcerted by his manner, looked at him beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is one of the <i>dramatis persona</i> in a pretty little
      comedy on which the curtain is not yet rung down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She greatly dared. &ldquo;Are you too in the caste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodore Weever deliberately helped himself to fish before replying. Then
      with equal deliberation he stared into her flushed and puzzled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. A leading part, perhaps, if you are the clever and
      conscientious woman I take you to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What part has my cousin Morland played?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave you the very simple task of guessing,&rdquo; said Weever; and he
      took advantage of her consternation to converse with his left-hand
      neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have painted a peculiarly successful fan, dear Mrs. Deering,&rdquo; said
      Colonel Pawley, in his purring voice. &ldquo;A wedding-present for our dear Miss
      Hardacre. I have never been so much pleased with anything before. I should
      like you to see it. When may I come and show it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wedding is fixed for two o'clock on Wednesday,&rdquo; said Connie,
      answering like a woman in a dream. The bright room, the crowd of diners,
      the music, the voice of the old man by her side, all faded from her
      senses, eclipsed by the ghastly light that dawned upon her. Only one
      meaning could be attached to Weever's insinuations. A touch on the arm
      brought her back to her surroundings with a start. It was Colonel Pawley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope there is nothing&mdash;&rdquo; he began, in a tone of great concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing. Really nothing. Do forgive me,&rdquo; she interrupted in
      confusion. &ldquo;You were telling me something. Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was about the fan,&rdquo; said Colonel Pawley, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for dear Miss Hardacre&mdash;a wedding-present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened to a repetition of the previous remarks and to a description
      of the painting, and this time replied coherently. She would be delighted
      to see both the fan and himself to-morrow morning. The kind old man
      launched into a prothalamion. The happy couple were a splendidly matched
      pair&mdash;Norma the perfect type of aristocratic English beauty; Morland
      a representative specimen of the British gentleman, the safeguard of the
      empire, a man, a thorough good fellow, incapable of dishonour, a landed
      proprietor. He had sketched out a little wedding-song which he would like
      to present with the fan. Might he show that, too, to Mrs. Deering?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dreadful dinner. On each side the distressing topic hemmed her
      in. In vain she tried to make her old friend talk of travel or gastronomy
      or the comforts of his club; perverse fate brought him always back to
      Norma's wedding. She was forced to listen, for to Weever she dared not
      address a remark. She longed for escape, for solitude wherein to envisage
      her dismay. No suspicion of Morland's complicity in the scandal had
      crossed her mind. Even now it seemed preposterous for a man of honour to
      have so acted towards his dearest and most loyal friend, to say nothing of
      the unhappy things that had gone before. Suddenly, towards the end of
      dinner, she revolted. She turned to Weever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe a word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what, dear lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what you have told me about Morland and Jimmie Padgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing,&rdquo; he replied in his
      expressionless way. &ldquo;Please remember that. I don't go about libelling my
      acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go and ask Morland straight,&rdquo; she said with spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au succès</i>,&rdquo; said Weever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner over, the little party went into the lounge. The screened light
      fell pleasantly on palms and pretty dresses, and made the place reposeful
      after the glare of the dining-room, whose red and white and gold still
      gleamed through the door above the steps. The red-coated band played a
      seductive, almost digestive air. A circle of comfortable chairs reserved
      by the host, invited the contented diner to languorous ease and restful
      gossip. It was the part of a Carlton dinner that Connie usually enjoyed
      the most. She still took her pleasures whole-heartedly, wherein lay much
      of her charm. The world, as Jimmie once told her, had not rubbed the dust
      off her wings. But to-night the sweet after-dinner hour was filled with
      fears and agitations, and while the party was settling down, she begged
      release from her host on the score of headache, and made her escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would carry out her threat to Weever. She would see Morland before she
      slept, and ask him to free her from this intolerable suspicion. She was a
      loyal, simple woman, for all her inconsequent ways and close experience of
      the insincerities of life; devoted to her friends, a champion of their
      causes; loving to believe the best, disturbed beyond due measure at being
      forced to believe the worst. Jimmie had most of her heart, more of it than
      she dared confess. But there were places in it both for Norma and for
      Morland. The latter was her cousin. She had known him all her life. To
      believe him to have played this sorry part in what it pleased Theodore
      Weever to call a pretty comedy was very real pain to the little lady. Her
      headache was no pretence. No spirit of curiosity or interference drove her
      to the Hardacres', where she knew she would find Morland; rather a desire
      to rid herself of a nightmare. Granted the possibility of baseness on
      Morland's part, all the dark places in the lamentable business became
      light. That was the maddening part of Weever's solution. And would it
      apply to the puzzle of the afternoon? Had Norma known? Had Jimmie told
      her? The pair had been agitated enough for anything to have happened.
      Theodore Weever, too, had calmly avowed himself an actor in the comedy.
      What part was he playing? She shivered at the conjecture. He looked like a
      pale mummy, she thought confusedly, holding in his dull eyes the
      inscrutable wisdom of the Sphinx. Meanwhile the horses were proceeding at
      a funereal pace. She pulled the checkstring and bade the coachman drive
      faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene that met her eyes when the servant showed her into the
      Hardacres' drawing-room was unexpected. Instead of the ordinary
      after-dinner gathering, only Mr. and Mrs. Hardacre and Morland were in the
      room. The master of the house, very red, very puffy, sat in an armchair
      before the fire, tugging at his mean little red moustache. Mrs. Hardacre,
      her face haggard with anxiety, stood apart with Morland, whose heavy
      features wore an expression of worry, apology, and indignation curiously
      blended. On a clear space of carpet a couple of yards from the door lay
      some strings of large pearls. Connie looked from one to the other of the
      three people who had evidently been interrupted in the midst of an anxious
      discussion. Here, again, something had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre shook hands with her mechanically. Mr. Hardacre apologised
      for not rising. That infernal gout again, he explained, pointing to the
      slashed slipper of a foot resting on a hassock. Norma had made it worse.
      He had been infernally upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norma?&rdquo; Connie turned and looked inquiringly at the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, an awful scene,&rdquo; said Morland, gloomily. &ldquo;I wish to heaven you had
      been here. You might have done something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you might bring her to her senses now, though I doubt it. I think
      she has gone crazy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has occurred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She declares she won't marry me, that's all. There's my wedding-present
      on the floor. Tore it from her neck as she made her exit. I don't know
      what's going to happen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up in her room smashing the rest of her wedding-presents, I suppose,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, what? Can't do that. All locked up downstairs in the library,&rdquo; came
      from the chair by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't make idiotic remarks, Benjamin,&rdquo; snapped his wife, viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was electric with irritation. Connie, a peacemaker at heart,
      forgot her mission in the face of the new development of affairs, and
      spoke soothingly. Norma could not break off the engagement three days
      before the wedding. Such things were not done. She would come round. It
      was merely an attack of nerves. They refused to be comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows what it is,&rdquo; said Morland. &ldquo;I thought things were perfectly
      square between us. She was n't cordial before dinner, I'll admit; but she
      let me put those beads round her neck. I asked her to wear them all the
      evening, as there were only the four of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Spencer-Temples sent an excuse this afternoon,&rdquo; Mrs. Hardacre
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She agreed,&rdquo; Morland continued. &ldquo;She wore them through dinner. Then
      everything any one of us said seemed to get on her nerves. I talked about
      the House. She withered me up with sarcasm. We talked about the wedding.
      She begged us, for God's sake, to talk of something else. We tried, so as
      to pacify her. But of course it was hardly possible. I said I had met Lord
      Monzie yesterday&mdash;told me he and his wife were coming on Wednesday.
      She asked whether Ascherberg and the rest of Monzie's crew of
      money-lenders, harlots, and fools were coming too. I defended Monzie. He's
      a friend of mine and a very decent sort. She shrugged her shoulders. You
      know her way. Mrs. Hardacre changed the subject. After dinner I saw her
      alone for a bit in the drawing-room. She asked me to take back the pearls.
      Said they were throttling her. Had n't we better reconsider the whole
      matter? There was still time. That was the beginning of it. Mr. and Mrs.
      Hardacre came up. We did all we knew. Used every argument. People invited.
      Bishop to perform ceremony. Duchess actually coming. Society expected us.
      The scandal. Her infernally bad treatment of myself. No good. Whatever we
      said only made her worse. Ended up with a diatribe against society. She
      was sick of its lies and its rottenness. She was going to have no more of
      it. She would breathe fresh pure air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord knows what she did n't say. All of us came in for it. Said
      shocking things about her mother. Said I did n't love her, had never loved
      her. A loveless marriage was horrible. Of course I am in love with her.
      You all know that. I said so. She would n't listen. Went on with her
      harangue. We could n't stop her. She would n't marry me for all the
      bishops and duchesses in the world. At last I lost my temper and said it
      was my intention to marry her, and marry me she should. Don't you think I
      was quite right? She lost hers, I suppose, tore off the pearls, made a
      sort of peroration, declaring she would sooner die than commit the infamy
      of marrying me&mdash;and that's the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw out his hands in desperation and turned away. His account of
      events from his point of view was accurate. To him, as to Norma's parents,
      her final revolt appeared the arbitrary act of unreason. They still
      smarted resentfully under her lashes, incapable of realising the sins for
      which they were flagellated.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had remained at home that afternoon and continued to practise
      insensibility, she would probably have followed the line of least
      resistance during the evening. Or, on the other hand, if she could have
      been alone, a night's fevered sleeplessness would have caused dull
      reaction in the morning. The cold contempt for things outside her, which
      had served for strength, was now gone, leaving a helpless woman to be
      swayed by passion or led spiritless by convention. The heroic in her
      needed the double spur. Passion shook her; miserable bondage, claiming
      her, drove her to rebellion. She rose to sublime heights, undreamed of in
      her earth-bound philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone into the street after her interview with Jimmie, white,
      palpitating, torn. Though the man had spoken tremulous words, it was the
      unspoken, the wave of longing and all unspeakable things in whose heaving
      bosom they had been caught, that mattered. The Garden of Enchantment had
      thrown wide its gates; she had been admitted within its infinitely
      reaching vistas, and flowers of the spirit had bared their hearts before
      her eyes. Dressing, she strove to kill the memory, to deafen her ears to
      the haunting music, to clear her brain of the intoxication. A thing hardly
      a woman, hardly a coherent entity, but half marble, half-consuming fire,
      stood before Morland, as he clasped the pearl necklace around her throat.
      The touch of it against her skin caused a shudder. Up to then sensation
      had blotted out thought. But now the brain worked with startling lucidity.
      There was yet time to escape from the thraldom. The Idea gathered strength
      from every word and incident during the meal. The commonness, sordidness,
      emptiness of the life behind and around and before her were revealed in
      the unpitying searchlight of an awakened soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pleaded with Morland for release. The necklace choked her. She
      unclasped it. He refused to take it back. She was his. He loved her. Her
      conduct was an outrage on his affections. She dared him to an expression
      of passionate feeling. He failed miserably, and her anger grew. Unhappily
      he spoke of an outrage upon Society. She fastened on the phrase. His
      affection and Society! One was worth the other. Society&mdash;the Mumbo
      Jumbo&mdash;the grotesque false god to which women were offered up in
      senseless sacrifice! Her mother instanced the bishop and the duchess as
      avatars of the divinity. Norma poured scorn on the hierarchy. Mrs.
      Hardacre implored her daughter by her love for her not to humiliate her
      thus in the world's eyes. She struck the falsest of notes. Norma turned on
      her, superb, dramatic, holding the three in speechless dismay. Love! what
      love had been given her that she should return? She had grown honest. The
      gods of that house were no longer her gods. They were paltry and
      dishonoured, shams and hypocrisies. Once she worshipped them. To that she
      had been trained from her cradle. Her nurses dangled the shams before her
      eyes. The women who taught her bent fawning knees before the shrines of
      the false gods. A mother's love? what had she learned from her mother? To
      simper and harden her heart. That the envy of other simpering hardened
      women was the ultimate good. That the dazzling end of a young girl's
      career was to capture some man of rank and fortune&mdash;that when she was
      married her lofty duty was to wear smarter clothes, give smarter parties,
      and to inveigle to her house by any base and despicable means smarter
      people than her friends. What had she learned from her mother? To let men
      of infamous lives leer at her because they had title or fortune. To pay
      court to shameless women in the hope of getting to know still more
      shameless men who might dishonour her with their name. She had never been
      young&mdash;never, never, with a young girl's freshness of heart. She
      spoke venom and was praised for wit. She was the finished product of a
      vapid world. Her whole existence had been an intricate elaboration of
      shams&mdash;miserable, empty, despicable futilities. How dared her mother
      stand before her and talk of love?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a quick angry scene, a crisp thud of the pearls on the floor, a
      stormy exit&mdash;and that, as Morland said, was the end of it. The three
      were left staring at each other in angry bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the face of this disaster Connie could not find it in her heart to
      reproach Morland, still less to hint at Theodore Weever's insinuation.
      Rather did she reproach herself for being the cause of the catastrophe,
      and she was smitten with a sense of guilt when Mrs. Hardacre turned upon
      her accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had tea with you, did n't she? Did you notice anything wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't seem quite herself&mdash;was nervous and strange,&rdquo; said
      Connie, diplomatically. &ldquo;I think I had better go up and talk to her,&rdquo; she
      added after an anxious pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do, for God's sake, Connie,&rdquo; said Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, smiled the ghost of her bright smile, and, glad of escape,
      went upstairs. The three sat in gloomy silence, broken only by Mr.
      Hardacre's maledictions on his gout. It was a bitter hour for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments Connie burst into the room, with a letter in her hand.
      She looked scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't find her. She's not in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the house!&rdquo; shrieked Mrs. Hardacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland brought his hand down heavily on the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard the front door slam half an hour ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is addressed to you, Mrs. Hardacre. It was stuck in her
      looking-glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre opened the note with shaky fingers. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I mean what I say. I had better leave you all, at least till after
      Wednesday. My stopping here would be more than you or I could stand.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardacre staggered with a gasp of pain to his feet, and his weak eyes
      glared savagely out of his puffy red face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damme, she must come back! If she does n't sleep here to-night, I'll cut
      her off. I won't have anything more to do with her. She has got to come
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Go and tell her, then,&rdquo; retorted his wife. &ldquo;Where do you
      suppose you are going to find her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she is sure to have gone to my house,&rdquo; said Connie. &ldquo;But suppose she
      has n't,&rdquo; said Morland, anxiously. &ldquo;She was in such a state that anything
      is possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me if you like. The brougham is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you go too, Eliza, and bring her home with you, d' ye hear?&rdquo; cried
      Mr. Hardacre. &ldquo;If you don't, she'll never set foot in my house again. I'm
      damned if she shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife looked at him queerly for a moment; then she meekly answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Benjamin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once only during their long married life had she flouted him when he had
      spoken to her like that. Then in ungovernable fury he had thrown a boot at
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hardacre glared at Morland and Connie, and scrambled cursing into his
      chair.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIII&mdash;NORMA'S HOUR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>OMETHING had
      happened&mdash;something mysterious, quickening; a pulsation of the inmost
      harmonies of life. Its tremendous significance Jimmie dared not
      conjecture. It was to be interpreted by the wisdom of the simplest, yet
      that interpretation he put aside. It staggered reason. It was enough for
      them to have met together in an unimagined intimacy of emotion, to have
      shared the throb of this spiritual happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was to be married in three days. He set the fact as a block to further
      investigation of the mystery. On this side his loyalty suffered no taint;
      their relations had but received, in some sense, sanctification. Beyond
      the barrier lay shame and dishonour. The two were to be married; therefore
      they loved. He disciplined a disordered mind with a logic of his own
      invention. It was a logic that entirely begged the question. Remembered
      words of Norma, &ldquo;Do you think much love has come my way? Yours are the
      only lips I have ever heard speak of it,&rdquo; fell outside his premises. They
      clamoured for explanation. So did the rich tremor of her voice. So did the
      lamentable lack of conviction in his reply. To these things he closed his
      intelligence. They belonged to the interpretation that staggered reason,
      that threatened to turn his fundamental conceptions into chaos. And past
      incidents came before him. During those last days in Wiltshire he had seen
      that her life lacked completion. That memory, too, disturbed his
      discipline. Fanatically he practised it, proving to himself that ice was
      hot and that the sun shone at midnight. She was happy in her love for
      Morland. She was happy in Morland's love for her. She had not identified
      with herself the imaginary woman of his adoration. She had not drunk in
      the outpouring of his passion. Her breath had not fallen warm upon his
      cheek. And the quickening of a wonderful birth had no reference to
      emotions and cravings quite different, intangible, inexpressible, existent
      in a far-away spirit land.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was strangely silent during their homeward journey in the omnibus and
      the simple evening meal, and Aline, sensitive to his mood, choked down the
      eager questions that rose to her lips. It was only after supper in the
      studio, when she lit the spill for Jimmie's pipe&mdash;her economical soul
      deprecating waste in matches&mdash;that she ventured to say softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you'll miss the picture, Jimmie dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited until the pipe was alight, and breathed out a puff of smoke with
      a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our happiness is made up of the things we miss,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a paradox, and I don't believe it,&rdquo; said Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything in life is a paradox,&rdquo; he remarked, thinking of his logic. He
      relapsed into his perplexed silence. Aline settled herself in her usual
      chair with her workbasket and her eternal sewing. This evening she was
      recuffing his shirts. Presently she held up a cuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See. I'm determined to make you smart and fashionable. I don't care what
      you say. These are square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are n't you putting a round man into a square cuff, my dear?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;Why should you be round? You are smart and rectangular. When
      you're tidied up&mdash;don't you know you are exceedingly good-looking,
      almost military?&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
She was delighted to get him back to foolish talk. His
      preoccupation had disturbed her. Like Connie Deering, she was femininely
      conscious that something out of the ordinary had passed between Norma and
      Jimmie, and apprehension as to her dear one's peace of mind had filled her
      with many imaginings. He returned a smiling answer. She bestirred herself
      to amuse. Had he remarked the man in the omnibus? His nose cut it into two
      compartments. What would he do if he had such a nose? Jimmie felt that he
      had been selfish and fell into the child's humour. He said that he would
      blow it. They discussed the subject of noses. He quoted Tristram Shandy.
      Did she remember him reading to her &ldquo;Slawkenbergius's Tale&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The silliest story I ever heard in my life!&rdquo; cried Aline. &ldquo;It had neither
      head nor tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the beauty of it,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;It is all nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The only story about a nose that is worth anything,&rdquo; Aline declared
      with conviction of her age and sex, &ldquo;is 'Cyrano de Bergerac.'&rdquo; She paused
      as a thought passed swiftly through her mind. &ldquo;Do you know, if you had a
      nose like that, you would remind me of Cyrano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't go about blustering and carving my fellow-citizens into
      mincemeat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But you&mdash;&rdquo; She began unreflectingly, then she stopped short in
      confusion. Cyrano, Roxana, Christian; Jimmie, Norma, Morland&mdash;the
      parallel was of an embarrassing nicety. She lost her head, reddened, saw
      that Jimmie had filled the gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> like him. It's splendid, but
      it's senseless. You are worth a million of the other man, and she knows it
      as well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She vindictively stitched at the cuff. Jimmie made no reply, but lay back
      smoking his pipe. Aline recovered and grew remorseful. She had destroyed
      with an idiotic word the little atmosphere of gaiety she had succeeded in
      creating. She pricked her finger several times At last she rose and knelt
      by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Jimmie. Don't be vexed with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, wrinkling his forehead half humorously, half sadly, and
      patted her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I think Slawkenbergius's the better tale. Shall
      I read it you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Jimmie,&rdquo; cried the girl, half crying, half laughing. &ldquo;Please
      don't, for heaven's sake. I've not been as naughty as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She resumed her sewing. They talked of daily things. Theodore Weever's
      purchases. The faun&mdash;he was sorry to lose it after its companionship
      for all these years. He would paint a replica&mdash;but it would not be
      the same thing. Other times, other feelings. Gradually the conversation
      grew spasmodic, dwindled. Jimmie brooded over his mystery, and Aline
      stitched in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whirr of the front door-bell aroused them. Aline put down her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Renshaw,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renshaw, a broken-down, out-at-heels, drunken black-and-white artist, once
      of amazing talent, was almost the only member of a large Bohemian coterie
      who continued to regard Jimmie as at home to his friends on Sunday
      evenings. Jimmie bore with the decayed man, and helped him on his way, and
      was pained when Aline insisted upon opening the windows after his
      departure. Renshaw had been a subject of contention between them for
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has only come to drink whisky and borrow money. Luckily we have n't
      any whisky in the house,&rdquo; said Aline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can give him beer, my child. And if the man is in need of half a
      crown, God forbid we should deny it him. Has Hannah come home yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so. It is n't ten o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let him in, dear,&rdquo; said Jimmie, finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aline went upstairs with some unwillingness. She disapproved entirely of
      Renshaw. She devoutly hoped the man was sober. As she opened the front
      door, the sharp sound of a turning cab met her ears, and the cloaked tall
      figure of a woman met her astonished eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hardacre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear. Won't you let me in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew aside quickly, and Norma passed into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; cried Aline. &ldquo;I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Is Mr.&mdash;is Jimmie at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; The girl's heart leaped at the name. She stared wide-eyed at
      Norma, whose features she could scarcely discern by the pin-point of gas
      in the hall-lamp. &ldquo;Yes. He is in the studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see him? Alone? Do you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In dumb astonishment Aline took the visitor to the head of the stairs,
      half lit by the streak of light from the open studio door.
      Norma paused, bent forward, and kissed her on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know my way,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie heard the rustle of skirts that were not Aline's, and springing to
      his feet, hurried towards the door. But before he could reach it Norma
      entered and stood before him. Her long dark silk evening cloak was open at
      the throat, showing glimpses of white bare neck. Its high standing collar
      set off the stately poise of her head. She wore the diamond star in her
      hair. To the wondering man who gazed at her she was a vision of radiant
      beauty. They held each other's eyes for a second or two; and the first
      dazzling glory in which she seemed to stand having faded, Jimmie read in
      her face that desperate things had come to pass. He caught her hands as
      she came swiftly forward. &ldquo;Why are you here? My God, why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could stand it no longer,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;I am not going to
      marry Morland. I have cut myself adrift. They all know it. I told them so
      this evening. The horror of it was unbearable. I have done with it forever
      and ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horror of it?&rdquo; echoed Jimmie.

</p>
<p>

&ldquo;Don't you think it a horror for two
      people to marry who have never even pretended to love each other? You said
      so this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released her hands and turned aside. Even the deep exulting sense of
      what her presence there must mean could not mitigate a terrible dismay.
      The interpretation that staggered reason was the true and only one. He had
      been living in a dream, among shadow-shapes which he himself had cast upon
      the wall. Even now he could not grasp completely the extent of his
      heroical self-deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has never been any love between you and Morland? It has been a
      cold-blooded question of a marriage of convenience? I thought so
      differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Since this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not since this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had n't been for you, I should have married him. You made it
      impossible. You taught me things. You made me hate myself and my mean
      ambitions. That was why I hesitated&mdash;put it off till Easter. If I had
      n't seen you this afternoon I should have gone through with it on
      Wednesday. When I got home I could n't face it. He put some pearls&mdash;a
      wedding-present&mdash;round my neck. They seemed like dead fingers choking
      out my soul. At last it grew horrible. I said things I don't remember now.
      I could n't stay in the house. It suffocated me. It would have sent me
      mad. I think a cab whirled me through the streets. I don't know. I have
      burnt my ships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, panting, with her hands on her bosom. His exultation grew,
      and fear with it. He was like a child trembling before a joy too great to
      be realised, frightened lest it should vanish. He said without looking at
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else should I go? Unless&mdash;&rdquo; She halted on the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke into an impatient cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, can't you speak? Do you want me to say everything? There is no need
      for you to be silent any longer.&rdquo; She faced him. &ldquo;Who was the woman&mdash;the
      picture woman we spoke of this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You. Who else?&rdquo; There was a quiver of silence. Then he
      caught her to him. He spoke foolish words. Their lips met, and passion
      held them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I anywhere else to go?&rdquo; she whispered; and he said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She released herself, somewhat pale and shaken. Jimmie, scarcely knowing
      what he did, took off her cloak and threw it on the long deal table. The
      sudden fresh chill on arms and neck made her realise that they were bare.
      It was his doing. She blushed. A delicious sense of shyness crept over
      her. It soon passed. But evanescent though it was, it remained long in her
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie took her in his arms again. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You madden me. I have loved you so long. I am like a parched soul by a
      pool of Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her by the hand, led her to his chair near the stove, and knelt by
      her side. She looked at him, the edges of her white teeth together, her
      lips parted. She was living the moment that counts for years in a woman's
      life. She can only live it once. Great joy or endless shame may come
      afterwards, but this moment shall ever be to her comfort or her despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked her how she had known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Heddon. Do you think I shall ever forget your words?&rdquo; She laughed
      divinely at the puzzledom on his face. &ldquo;No. You were too loyal to tell me&mdash;but
      you told Connie Deering. Hush! Don't start. Connie did not betray you. She
      is the staunchest soul breathing. You and she were on the slope by the
      croquet lawn&mdash;do you remember? There was a hedge of clipped yew above&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you overheard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again, happily, at his look of distress. &ldquo;I should be rather
      pleased&mdash;now&mdash;if I were you,&rdquo; she said in the softer and deeper
      tones of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later he said, &ldquo;You must give me back the portrait. I shall
      burn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a million times more beautiful, more adorable.&rdquo; He asked her when
      she had begun to think of him&mdash;the eternal, childlike question. She
      met his lover's gaze steadily. Frankness was her great virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems now that I have cared for you since the first day. You soon came
      into my life, but I did n't know how much you represented. Then I heard
      you speaking to Connie. That mattered a great deal. When that man shot
      you, I knew that I loved you. I thought you were dead. I rushed down the
      slope and propped you up against my knees&mdash;and I thought I should go
      mad with agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of that,&rdquo; said Jimmie in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became suddenly thoughtful, rose to his feet and regarded her with a
      changed expression, like that of a man awakened from a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is going to be the end of this?&rdquo; he asked.

</p>
<p>

Norma, for once
      unperceptive and replying to a small preoccupation of her own, flushed to
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Connie well enough to look her up and ask her for hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't thinking of that,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;We have been like children and
      had our hour of joy, without thinking of anything else. Now we must be
      grown-up people. After what has passed between us, I could only ask you to
      be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here for you to ask me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to do so, dear. I bear a dishonoured name. The wonder and
      wild desire of you made me forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him strangely, her lips working in the shadow of her old
      smile of mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That proves to me that it is your name and not yourself that is
      dishonoured. If it had been yourself, you would not have forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie drew himself up, and there was a touch of haughtiness in his manner
      that Norma in her woman's way noted swiftly. In spite of his homeliness
      there was the undefinable spirit of the great gentleman in Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dishonoured. The matter was public property. I discuss it with no
      one, least of all with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let it never be mentioned again between us. I
      range myself with Aline. I shall believe what I like. You can't prevent my
      doing that, can you? I choose to believe you are the one thing God made in
      which I can find happiness. That's enough for me, and it ought to be
      enough for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie put his hand on her shoulder, deeply moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest, you must n't say things like that.&rdquo; He repeated the words,
      &ldquo;You mustn't say things like that.&rdquo; Then he was conscious of the warm
      softness on which his hand rested. She raised her arm and touched his
      fingers. It was a moment of deep temptation. He resisted, drew his hand
      away gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another reason why it cannot be,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You belong to a
      world of wealth and luxury, I have been in poverty all my life. God forbid
      I should complain. I have never done so. But it is a life of struggle for
      daily bread. Aline and I are used to it. We laugh. We often dine with Duke
      Humphrey. We make believe like the marchioness. What the discipline of
      life and a sort of gipsy faith in Providence have made us regard as a
      jest, would be to you a sordid shift, an intolerable ugliness stripping
      life of its beauty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must talk and you must listen,&rdquo; he said with a certain masterful
      dignity. &ldquo;Look at you now, in the exquisite loveliness of your dress, with
      that diamond star in your hair, with that queenly presence of yours. Do
      you fit in with all this? Your place is in great houses, among historic
      pictures, rare carpets, furniture that is invested with the charm of an
      artist's touch. The chair you are sitting in&mdash;the leather is split
      and the springs are broken.&rdquo; He was walking now backwards and forwards
      across the studio, fulfilling his task bravely, scarcely trusting himself
      to look at her. &ldquo;Your place,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is among the great ones of
      the earth&mdash;princes, ambassadors, men of genius. Here are but the
      little folk: even should they come, as they used to do: homely men with
      rough ways and their wives&mdash;sweet simple women with a baby and a
      frock a year, God help them! I can't ask you to share this life with me,
      my dear. I should be a scoundrel if I did. As it is, I have fallen below
      myself in letting you know that I love you. You must forgive me. A man is,
      after all, a man, whether he be beggar or prince. You must go back into
      your world and forget it all. The passion-flower cannot thrive in the
      hedge with the dog-rose, my dearest. It will pine and fade. We must end it
      all. Don't you see? You don't know what poverty means. Even decent poverty
      like ours. Look&mdash;the men you know have valets to dress them&mdash;when
      you came Aline was sewing new cuffs on my shirts. I don't suppose you ever
      knew that such things were done. Mere existence is a matter of ever
      anxious detail. I am a careless fellow, I am a selfish brute, like most
      men, and give over to the women folk around me the thousand harassing
      considerations of ways and means for every day in every year. But I see
      more than they think. Aline can tell you. I dare n't, my dear, ask you to
      share this life with me. I dare n't, I dare n't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to a stop in front of her; saw her leaning over the arm of the
      chair away from him, her face covered by her hands. Her white shoulders
      twitched in little convulsive movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear&mdash;my dear&mdash;&rdquo; he said in a bewilderment of distress;
      and kneeling by her, he took her wrists and drew them to him. The palms of
      her hands and her cheeks were wet with miserable tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must you think of me? What futile, feeble creature must you think
      me? Heaven knows I'm degraded enough&mdash;but not to that level. Do you
      suppose I ever thought you a rich man? Oh, you have hurt me&mdash;flayed
      me alive. I did n't deserve it! I would follow you in rags barefoot
      through the world. What does it matter so long as it is you that I
      follow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could mortal man do but take the wounded woman of his idolatry into
      his arms? The single-hearted creature, aghast at the havoc he had wrought,
      bitterly reproached himself for want of faith in the perfect being. He had
      committed a horrible crime, plunged daggers, stab after stab, into that
      radiant bosom. She sobbed in his embrace&mdash;a little longer than was
      strictly necessary. Tears and sobs were a wonder to her, who since early
      childhood had never known the woman's relief of weeping. It came upon her
      first as a wondrous new-found emotion; when his strong arms were about
      her, as an unutterably sweet solace. And the man's voice in her ears was
      all that has nearly been said but never been quite said in music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she drew herself away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am such a fool that I can't sew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank back on his heels. She rose, helping herself to rise by a hand on
      his arm, an action wonderfully sweet in its intimacy, and crossed over to
      Aline's cane-bottomed, armless easy-chair. She plucked the shirt from the
      basket on the top of which Aline had thrust it, groped among the
      wilderness of spools, tape, bits of ribbon, scissors, needle-cases,
      patterns and year-old draper's bills for a thimble, found the needle
      sticking in the work, and began to sew with a little air of defiance.
      Jimmie looked on, ravished. He drew nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you mean to say you can do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing she could not do in this hour of exaltation. She had
      found herself&mdash;simple woman with simple man. It was her hour. Her
      feet trod the roots of life; her head touched the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit in your chair and smoke, and let us see what it will be like,&rdquo; she
      commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed. But whether it was tobacco or gunpowder in his old briarwood
      pipe he could not have told. The poor wretch was mazed with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little Aline is all by herself upstairs,&rdquo; said Norma, after a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forgive me,&rdquo; cried Jimmie, starting up. &ldquo;I had n't thought about
      her!&rdquo;

      Chapter XXIV&mdash;MRS. HARDACRE FORGETS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HILE this tragical
      comedy of the domestic felicities was being enacted, Connie Deering's
      brougham containing three agitated, silent, human beings was rapidly
      approaching the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had made certain of finding Norma at Bryanston Square. The news that
      she had not arrived disquieted them. Morland anxiously suggested the
      police. They had a hurried colloquy, Morland and Connie standing on the
      pavement, Mrs. Hardacre inside the carriage, thrusting her head through
      the window. Connie falteringly confessed to the meeting of Jimmie and
      Norma in the afternoon. Something serious had evidently passed between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morland broke into an oath. &ldquo;By God! That's where she's gone. Damn him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get her away at all costs,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, tensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is my fault,&rdquo; said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; Mrs. Hardacre replied brutally. &ldquo;The best you can do is
      to help us to rescue her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They started. The brougham was small, the air heavy, their quest
      distasteful, its result doubtful. The sense of fretfulness became acute.
      Mrs. Hardacre gave vent to her maternal feelings. When she touched on the vile seducer of her daughter's affections, Connie turned upon her almost
      shrewishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my carriage, and I am not going to hear my dearest friend abused
      in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland sat silent and worried. When they stopped at the house, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall stay outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie, angry with him for having damned Jimmie, bent forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid of facing Jimmie?&rdquo; she said with a little note of
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he replied viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Aline ran into the studio with a scared face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up to her, and she whispered into his ear; then he turned to
      Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother and Connie and Morland are upstairs. I don't suppose you are
      anxious to see them. May I tell them what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma rose and joined him in the centre of the studio. &ldquo;I would sooner
      tell them myself. Can they come down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave the order to Aline. Before going, she took him by the arm and
      swiftly glancing at Norma, asked eagerly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wonder of wonders, dear,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a glad cry she ran upstairs and brought down the visitors, who were
      waiting in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie stood by the open door to receive them. Norma retired to the far
      end of the studio. She held her head high, and felt astonishingly cool and
      self-possessed. Mrs. Hardacre entered first, and without condescending to
      look at Jimmie marched straight up to her daughter. Then came Connie and
      Aline, the girl excited, her arm round her friend's waist. Morland, on
      entering, drew Jimmie aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've bested me,&rdquo; he said in an angry whisper. &ldquo;You held the cards, I
      know. I did n't think you would use them. I wish you joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flash of pain and indignation lit Jimmie's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, man! Have you sunk so low as to accuse me of that? <i>Me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away. Morland caught him by the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jimmie shook him off and went to the side of Norma, who was listening
      to her mother's opening attack. It was shrill and bitter. When she paused,
      Norma said stonily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going home with you to-night, mother. I sleep at Connie's. She
      will not refuse me a bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father means what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I, mother. I can manage pretty well without your protection till I
      am married. Then I sha'n't need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray whom are you going to marry?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Hardacre, acidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was obvious,&rdquo; said Norma. &ldquo;Mr. Padgate has done me the
      very great honour to ask me to be his wife. I have agreed. I am over age
      and a free agent, so there's nothing more to be said, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre refused to take the announcement seriously. Her thin lips
      worked into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is sheer folly, my dear Norma. Over age or not we can't allow you to
      disgrace yourself and us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have never had such honour conferred on us in all our lives,&rdquo; said
      Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre shrugged her shoulders pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among sane folks it would be a disgrace and a scandal. Even Mr. Padgate
      would scarcely take advantage of a fit of hysterical folly.&rdquo; She turned to
      Jimmie. &ldquo;I assure you she is hardly responsible for her actions. You are
      aware what you would be guilty of in bringing her into this&mdash;this&mdash;?&rdquo;
       She paused for a word and waved her hand around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hovel?&rdquo; suggested Jimmie, grimly. &ldquo;Yes. I am aware of it. Miss Hardacre
      must not consider herself bound by anything she has said to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie Deering, who had come up waiting for a chance to speak, her
      forget-me-not eyes curiously hard and dangerous, broke in quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you say <i>even</i> Mr. Padgate, Mrs. Hardacre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Padgate has a reputation&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. Hardacre, with an
      expressive gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He checked his advocate. &ldquo;Please, no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not, indeed! Are you coming, Norma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go,&rdquo; said Jimmie, softly. &ldquo;Why quarrel with your parents?
      To-morrow, a week, a month hence you can tell me your wishes. I set you
      quite free.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
Norma made a movement of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't make me say things I should regret&mdash;I am not going to change
      my mind. No, mother, I am not coming.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
Morland had not said a word, but
      stood in the background, hating himself. Only Connie's taunt had caused
      him to enter this maddeningly false position. He knew that his accusation,
      though he believed it true at the time, was false and base. Jimmie was
      true gold. He had not betrayed him. Connie, when Jimmie had checked her,
      went across to Morland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> believe that Jimmie deserves his reputation?&rdquo; she said for
      his ears alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he answered moodily, kicking at a hassock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it's damnable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quick glance exchanged completed her assurance. He saw that she knew,
      and despised him. For a few moments he lost consciousness of externals in
      alarmed contemplation of this new thing&mdash;a self openly despised by
      one of his equals. Mrs. Hardacre's voice aroused him. She was saying her
      final words to Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you. When you are in the gutter with this person, don't come to
      ask me for help. You can <i>encanailler</i> yourself as much as you like,
      for all I care. This adventurer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie interposed in his grand manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray remember, Mrs. Hardacre, that for the moment you are my guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your guest!&rdquo; For the second time that evening she had been rebuked. Her
      eyes glittered with spite and fury. She lost control. &ldquo;Your guest! If I
      went to rescue my daughter from a house of ill fame, should I regard
      myself as a guest of the keeper? How dare you? How do I know what does n't
      go on in this house? That girl over there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma sprang forward and gripped her by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook herself free. &ldquo;How do I know? How <i>do</i> you know? The man's
      name stinks over England. No decent woman has anything to do with him.
      Have you forgotten last autumn? That beastly affair? If you choose to
      succeed the other woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn it!&rdquo; burst out Morland, suddenly. &ldquo;This is more than I can
      stand. Have you forgotten what I told you a week ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The venomous woman was brought to a full stop. She stared helplessly at
      Morland, drawing quick panting breaths. She had forgotten that he was in
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cynicism was too gross even for him. There are limits to every man's
      baseness and cowardice. Moreover, his secret was known. To proclaim it
      himself was a more heroic escape than to let it be revealed with killing
      contempt by another. The two forces converged suddenly, and found their
      resultant in his outburst. It was characteristic of him that there should
      be two motives, though which one was the stronger it were hard to say&mdash;most
      likely revolt at the cynicism, for he was not a depraved man.
 </p>
    <p>
Norma looked
      swiftly from one to the other.
 </p>
    <p>
&ldquo;What did you tell my mother a week ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie picked up Morland's crush-hat that lay on the table and thrust it
      into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's enough, my dear good fellow. Don't talk about those horrible
      things. Mrs. Hardacre would like to be going. You had better see her home.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
He pushed him, as he spoke, gently towards Mrs. Hardacre, who
      was already moving towards the door. But Norma came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist upon knowing,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Jimmie, in an agitated voice. &ldquo;Let the dead past bury its
      dead. Don't rake up old horrors.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>
Morland cleared himself away from Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! You are a good man. I've been an infernal blackguard. Everybody
      had better know. If Jimmie hadn't taken it upon himself, that madman would
      have shot me. He would have hit the right man. I wish to heaven he had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma grew white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is what you told my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I ought to,&rdquo; said Morland, looking away from the anxious faces
      around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn't have done it,&rdquo; said Jimmie, in a low voice. He was bent
      like a guilty person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma went to the door and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly see my mother into a cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take the brougham,&rdquo; said Connie. &ldquo;Norma and I will take a cab
      later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morland made a movement as if to speak to Jimmie. Norma intercepted him,
      waved her hand towards her mother, who stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go. Please go,&rdquo; she said in a constrained voice. &ldquo;Take the brougham. She
      will catch cold while you are whistling for a cab&mdash;and you will be
      the sooner gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hardacre, stunned by the utter disaster that she had brought about,
      mechanically obeyed Morland's gesture and passed through the open door,
      without looking at her daughter. As Morland passed her, he plucked up a
      little courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We both lied for your sake,&rdquo; he said; which might have been an apology or
      a tribute. Norma gave no sign that she had heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie followed them upstairs and opened the front door. He put out his
      hand to Morland, who took it and said &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; in a shamefaced way.
      Mrs. Hardacre stepped into the brougham like a somnambulist. Morland did
      not accompany her. He had seen enough of Mrs. Hardacre for the rest of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jimmie went down to the studio, he saw Norma and Connie bending over
      a chair in the far corner. Aline had fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They administered what restoratives were to hand&mdash;water and Connie's
      smelling-salts&mdash;and took the girl up to her bedroom, where she was
      left in charge of Mrs. Deering. Jimmie and Norma returned to the studio.
      The preoccupation of tending Aline, whose joy in the utter vindication of
      her splendid faith had been too sudden a strain upon an overwrought
      nervous system, had been welcomed almost as a relief to the emotional
      tenseness. They had not spoken of the things that were uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down in their former places, without exchanging a remark. Jimmie
      took up his pipe from the table by his side, and knocked the ashes into
      the ash-tray and blew through it to clear it. Then he began to fill it
      from his old tobacco-pouch, clumsy as all covered pouches are and rough
      with faded clumps of moss-roses and forget-me-nots worked by Aline years
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you go on with the sewing?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited a second or two before answering, and when she spoke did not
      trust herself to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to say something, I know,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;But there
      are things one can't talk of, only feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never need talk of them,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;They are over and done with.
      Old, forgotten, far-off things now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they? You don't understand. They will always remain. They make up
      your life. You are too big for such as me altogether. By rights I should
      be on my knees before you. Thank God, I did n't wait until I learned all
      this, but came to you in faith. I feel poor enough to hug that to myself
      as a virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad you believed in me,&rdquo; said Jimmie, laying down the unlit
      pipe which he had been fondling. &ldquo;I would n't be human if I did n't&mdash;but
      you must n't exaggerate. Exposure would have ruined Morland's career, and
      I thought it would go near breaking your heart. To me, an insignificant
      devil, what did it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n't my love for you matter? Did n't all that you have suffered
      matter? Oh, don't minimise what you have done. I am afraid of you. Your
      thoughts are not my thoughts, and your ways not my ways. You will always
      be among the stars while I am crawling about the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie rose hurriedly and fell at her feet, and took both her hands and
      placed them against his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, moved to his depths. &ldquo;My dear. My wonderful,
      worshipped, God-sent dear. You are wrong&mdash;utterly wrong. I am only a
      poor fool of a man, as you will soon find out, whose one merit is to love
      you. I would sell my body and my soul for you. If I made a little
      sacrifice for the love of you, what have you done tonight for me&mdash;the
      sacrifice of all the splendour and grace of life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lies and the rottenness,&rdquo; said Norma, with a shiver. &ldquo;Did you
      comprehend my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands from his face and kissed her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, those are the unhappy, far-off things. Let us forget them. They
      never happened. Only one thing in the world has ever happened. You have
      come to me, Norma,&rdquo; he said softly, speaking her name for the first
      tremulous time, &ldquo;Norma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met, and then their lips. The world stood still for a space.
      She sighed and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to teach me many things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will have to begin
      at the very beginning.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XXV&mdash;THE LAND OF ENCHANTMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>VERY one knew that
      the marriage arranged between Morland King and Norma Hardacre would not
      take place. It was announced in the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; and &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; on the
      Tuesday morning; those bidden to the wedding received hurried messages,
      and a day or two later the wedding-gifts were returned to the senders, who
      stored them up for some happier pair. But the new engagement upon which
      Norma had entered remained a secret. Norma herself did not desire to
      complete the banquet of gossip she had afforded society, and Mrs. Hardacre
      was not anxious to fill to overflowing the cup of her own humiliation. The
      stricken lady maintained a discreet reserve. The lovers had quarrelled,
      Norma had broken off the match and would not be going out for some time.
      She even defied the duchess, who commanded an explicit statement of
      reasons. Her grace retorted severely that she ought to have brought her
      daughter up better, and signified that this was the second time Norma had
      behaved with scandalous want of consideration for her august convenience.
      &ldquo;She shall not have the opportunity of doing it again. I dislike being
      mixed up in scandals,&rdquo; said the duchess; and Mrs. Hardacre saw the gates
      of Wiltshire House and Chiltern Towers closed to her forever. But of the
      impossible painter wretch she spoke not a word, hoping desperately that in
      some mysterious fashion the God of her fathers would avert this crowning
      disgrace from them and would lead Norma forth again into the paths of
      decency and virtue. As for her husband, he stormily refused to speak or
      hear the outcast's name. He had done with her. She should never sleep
      again beneath the roof she had dishonoured. He would not allow her a
      penny. He would cut her out of his will. She had dragged him in the mud,
      and by heaven! she could go to the devil! It took much to rouse the
      passions of the feeble, mean-faced little man; but once they were roused,
      he had the snarling tenacity of the fox. Mrs. Hardacre did not tell him of
      Morland's confession and the rehabilitation of his rival. The memory of
      her stunning humiliation brought on a feeling akin to physical nausea. She
      strove to bury it deep down in her sub-consciousness, beneath all the
      other unhallowed memories. There were none quite so rank. On the other
      hand, her husband's vilification of the detested creature was a source of
      consolation which she had no desire to choke. Why should she deny herself
      this comfort. The supreme joy of vitriol throwing was not countenanced in
      her social sphere. At odd times she regretted that she was a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the black fog of depression darkened Devonshire Place, in
      neighbouring parts of London the days were radiant. A thousand suns
      glorified the heavens and the breaths of a thousand springs perfumed the
      air. It was a period of exaggeration, unreality, a page out of a fairy
      tale lived and relived. Norma abandoned herself to the intoxication,
      heedless of the fog in Devonshire Place, and the decent grey of the world
      elsewhere. She refused to think or speculate. Rose veils shrouded the
      future; the present was a fantasy of delight. For material things, food,
      shelter, raiment, she had no concern. Connie fed and housed her, making
      her the thrice welcome guest, the beloved sister. From society she
      withdrew altogether. Visitors paid calls, odd people were entertained at
      meals, the routine of a wealthy woman's establishment proceeded in its
      ordinary course, and Norma's presence in the house remained unknown and
      unsuspected. She was there in hiding. The world was given to understand
      that she was in Cornwall. Even common life had thus its air of romance and
      mystery. Being as it were a fugitive, she had no engagements. There was a
      glorious incongruity in the position. She regarded the beginnings of the
      London season with the amused detachment of a disembodied spirit
      revisiting the scenes of which it once made a part. Morning, afternoon,
      and evening she was free&mdash;an exhilarating novelty. Nobody wanted to
      see her save Jimmie; save him she wanted to see nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met every day&mdash;sometimes in the sitting-room on the ground floor
      which Connie had set apart for her guest's exclusive use, and sometimes in
      Jimmie's studio. Now and then, when the weather was fine, they walked
      together in sweet places unfrequented by the fashionable world, Regent's
      Park and Hampstead Heath, fresh woods and pastures new to Norma, who had
      heard of the heath vaguely as an undesirable common where the lower orders
      wore each other's hats and shied at cocoanuts. Its smiling loneliness and
      April beauty, seen perhaps through the artist's eyes, enchanted her.
      Jimmie pointed out its undulations; like a bosom, said he, swelling with
      the first breaths of pure air on its release from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of all she loved to drive up to St. John's Wood after dinner and
      burst upon him unexpectedly. The new Bohemian freedom of it all was a part
      of the queer delicious life. She laughed in anticipation at his cry of
      delighted welcome. When she heard it, her eyes grew soft. To lift her veil
      and hang back her head to receive his kiss on her lips was an ever-new
      sensation. The intimacy had a bewildering sweetness. To complete it she
      threw aside gloves and jacket and unpinned her hat, a battered gilt Empire
      mirror over the long table serving her to guide the necessary touches to
      her hair. Although she did not repeat the little comedy of the shirt which
      had been inspired by the exaltation of a rare moment, yet she sat in
      Aline's chair, now called her own, and knitted at a silk tie she was
      making for him. She had learned the art from her aunt in Cornwall, and she
      brought the materials in a little black silk bag slung to her wrist. The
      housewifely avocation fitted in with the fairy tale. Jimmie smoked and
      talked, the most responsive and least tiring of companions. His allusive
      speech, that of the imaginative and cultured man, in itself brought her
      into a world different from the one she had left. His simplicity, his
      ignorance of the ways of women, his delight at the little discoveries she
      allowed him to make, gave it a touch of Arcadia. In passionate moments
      there was the unfamiliar, poetic, rhapsodic in his utterance which turned
      the world into a corner of heaven. And so the magic hours passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe I have found a soul,&rdquo; she remarked on one of these evenings,
      &ldquo;and that's why I must be so immoderately happy. I'm like a child with a
      new toy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was unconscious of the instinctive, pitiless analysis of herself; and
      Jimmie, drunk with the wonder of her, did not heed the warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of their future life together they only spoke as happy lovers in the rosy
      mist shed about them by the veil. They dwelt in the glamour of the fairy
      tale, where the princess who marries the shepherd lives not only happy
      ever afterwards, but also delicately dressed and daintily environed, her
      chief occupation being to tie silk bows round the lambs' necks, and to
      serve to her husband the whitest of bread and the whitest of cheese with
      the whitest of hands. Their forecast of the future might have been an
      Idyll of Theocritus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be the inspiration of all my pictures, dear,&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will sit for you as a model, if I am good enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; Language crumbled into meaningless vocables before her
      infinite perfection. &ldquo;I have had a little talent. You will give me
      genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will also give you your dinner.&rdquo; She laughed adorably. &ldquo;Do you know
      Connie told me I must learn to cook. I had my first lesson this morning in
      her kitchen&mdash;a most poetic way of doing sweetbreads. Do you like
      sweetbreads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I come to think of it, I do. Enormously. I wonder why Aline never has
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have some&mdash;our first lunch&mdash;at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will cook them?&rdquo; cried the enraptured man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;In a most becoming white apron. You'll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be like a goddess taking her turn preparing the daily ambrosia for
      Olympus!&rdquo; said Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion they spoke of summer holidays. They would take a
      little cottage in the country. It would have honeysuckle over the porch,
      and beds of mignonette under the windows, and an old-fashioned garden full
      of stocks and hollyhocks and sunflowers. There would be doves and bees.
      They would go out early and come home with the dew on their feet. They
      would drink warm milk from the cow. They would go a hay-making. Norma's
      idea of the pastoral pathetically resembled that of the Petit Trianon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magic of the present with its sincerity of passionate worship on the
      part of the man, and its satisfaction of a soul's hunger on the part of
      the woman, was in itself enough to blind their eyes to the possible prose
      of the future. Another interest, one of the sweetest of outside interests
      that can bind two lovers together, helped to fix their serious thoughts to
      the immediate hour. Side by side with their romance grew up another,
      vitally interwoven with it for a spell and now springing clear into
      independent life. The two children Aline and Tony Merewether had found
      each other again, and the fresh beauty of their young loves lit the deeper
      passion of the older pair with the light of spring sunrise. In precious
      little moments of confidence Aline opened to Norma her heart's dewy
      happiness, and what Norma in delicate honour could divulge she told to
      Jimmie, who in his turn had his little tale to bear. More and more was
      existence like the last page of a fairy book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reconciliation of the younger folk had been a very simple matter. It
      was the doing of Connie Deering. The morning after Morland's confession
      she summoned Tony Merewether to an interview. He arrived wondering. She
      asked him point blank:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you still in love with Aline Marden or have you forgotten all about
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow declared his undying affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware that you have treated her shamefully?&rdquo; she said severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the most miserable dog unhung,&rdquo; exclaimed the youth. He certainly
      looked miserable, thin, and worried. He gave his view of the position.
      Connie's heart went out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I told you that everything was cleared up and you could go to
      Aline with a light conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should go crazy with happiness!&rdquo; he cried, springing to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aline deserves a sane husband. She is one in a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is one in twenty thousand million!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she goes, hand in hand with Jimmie Padgate. It's to tell you that
      I've asked you to come. I hope you'll let them both know you're aware of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied that he was worthy of her confidence, she told him briefly what
      had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now what are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? I'll go on my knees. I'll grovel at his feet. I'll ask him to make me
      a door-mat. I'll do any mortal thing Aline tells me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go now and do your penance and be happy,&rdquo; Connie said, holding out
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how I can thank you, Mrs. Deering,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You are the
      most gracious woman that ever lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later an impassioned youth was speeding in a hansom cab to
      Friary Grove. But Connie, with the memory of his clear-cut, radiant young
      face haunting her, sighed. Chance decreed that the very moment should
      bring her a letter from Jimmie, written that morning, full of his wonder
      and gratitude. She sighed again, pathetically, foolishly, unreasonably
      feeling left out in the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether it would do me good to cry,&rdquo; she said, half aloud. But
      the footman entering with the announcement that the carriage which was to
      take her to her dressmaker was at the door, settled the question. She had
      to content herself with sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony Merewether did not go on his knees, as Aline had ordained; but he
      made his apology in so frank and manly a way that Jimmie forgave him at
      once. Besides, said he, what had he to forgive?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like Didymus,&rdquo; said Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie laughed as he clapped him on the shoulder and pushed him out of the
      studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better cultivate the feeling. He became a saint eventually. Aline
      will help to make you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If plain indication of another's infirmities can tend to qualify him for
      canonisation, Aline certainly justified Jimmie's statement. She did not
      confer her pardon so readily on the doubting disciple. His offence had
      been too rank. It was not merely a question of his saying a <i>credo</i>
      and then taking her into his arms. She exacted much penance before she
      permitted this blissful consummation. He had to woo and protest and humble
      himself exceedingly. But when she had reduced him to a proper state of
      penitence, she gave him plenary absolution and yielded to his kiss, as she
      had been yearning to do since the beginning of the interview. After that
      she settled down to her infinite delight. Nothing was lacking in the new
      rapturous scheme of existence. The glory of Jimmie was vindicated. Tony
      had come back to her. The bars to their marriage had vanished. Not only
      was Tony a man of substance with the legacy of eight thousand pounds that
      had been left him, and therefore able to support as many wives as the
      Grand Turk, but Jimmie no longer had to be provided for. The wonder of
      wonders had happened; she could surrender her precious charge with a free
      conscience and a heart bursting with gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the happiness of each pair of lovers caught a reflection from that of
      the other, and its colour was rendered ever so little fictitious, unreal.
      The light of spring sunrise, exquisite though it is, invests things with a
      glamour which the light of noon dispels. The spectacle of the young
      romance unfolding itself before the eyes of Jimmie and Norma completed
      their delicious sense of the idyllic; but the illusive atmosphere thus
      created caused them to view their own romance in slightly false
      perspective. Essentially it was a drama of conflict&mdash;themselves
      against the pettinesses and uglinesses of the world; apparently it was a
      pastoral among spring flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cause that contributed to Norma's unconcern for the future was her
      exaggerated sense of the man's loftiness of soul. Instead of viewing him
      as a lovable creature capable of the chivalrous and the heroic and
      afforded by a happy fate an opportunity of displaying these qualities&mdash;for
      the opportunity makes the hero as much as it does the thief&mdash;she
      grovelled whole-sexedly before an impossible idol imbued with impossible
      divinity. While knitting silk ties and devising with him the preparation
      of foodstuffs (which she did not realise he would not be able to afford)
      she was conscious of a grace in the trifling, all the more precious
      because of these little earthly things midway between the empyrean and the
      abyss which they respectively inhabited. In the deeply human love of each
      was a touch of the fantastic. To Jimmie she was the Princess of
      Wonderland, the rare Lady of Dreams; to Norma he appeared little less than
      a god.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was talking one evening with Connie Deering in a somewhat exalted
      strain of her own unworthiness and Jimmie's condescension, when the little
      lady broke into an unwonted expression of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, every foolish woman is a valet to her hero. You would like
      to clean his boots, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Connie,&rdquo; cried Norma, alarmed, &ldquo;whatever is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you two had better get married as quickly as possible. It is
      getting on one's nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma stiffened. &ldquo;I am sorry&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie interrupted her. &ldquo;Don't be silly. There's nothing for you to be
      sorry about.&rdquo; She brightened and laughed, realising the construction Norma
      had put upon her words. &ldquo;I am only advising you for your good. I had half
      an hour's solitary imprisonment with Theodore Weever this afternoon. He
      always takes it out of me. It's like having a bath with an electric eel.
      He called this afternoon to get news of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me?&rdquo; asked Norma serenely, settling herself in the depths of her
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is like an eel,&rdquo; Connie exclaimed with a shiver. &ldquo;He's the
      coldest-blooded thing I've ever come across. I told you about the dinner
      at the Carlton, did n't I? It appears that he reckoned on my doing just
      what I rushed off to do. It makes me so angry!&rdquo; she cried with feminine
      emphasis on the last word. &ldquo;Of course he did n't tell me so brutally&mdash;he
      has a horrid snake-like method of insinuation. He had counted on my
      getting at the truth which he had guessed and so stopping the marriage.
      'I'm a true prophet,' he said. 'I knew that marriage would never come
      off.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he told me,&rdquo; said Norma. &ldquo;Do you know, there must be some goodness in
      him to have perceived the goodness in Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he's a disembodied spirit without either goodness or badness&mdash;a
      sort of non-moral monster.&rdquo; Connie was given to hyperbole in her likes and
      dislikes. She continued her tale. He had come to ask her advice. Now that
      Miss Hardacre was free, did Mrs. Deering think he might press his suit
      with advantage? His stay in Europe was drawing to a close. He would like
      to take back with him to New York either Miss Hardacre or a definite
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You certainly cannot take back Miss Hardacre,' I said, 'because she is
      going to marry Jimmie Padgate.' I thought this would annihilate him. But
      do you think he moved a muscle? Not he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked Norma, lazily amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This is getting somewhat monotonous,'&rdquo; replied Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma laughed. &ldquo;Nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He began to talk about theatres. He has the most disconcerting way of
      changing the conversation. But on leaving he sent his congratulations to
      you, and said that you were always to remember that you were the wife
      specially designed for him by Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear thing,&rdquo; said Norma, &ldquo;and did that get on your nerves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would n't it get on yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma shook her head. &ldquo;I have n't any nerves for things to get on. People
      don't have nerves when they're happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you happy, really, really happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am deliciously happy,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to bed laughing at the discomfiture of Weever and the remoteness
      of him and of the days last summer when she first met him among the
      Monzies' disreputable crowd. He belonged to a former state of existence.
      Jimmie's portrait, which had been put for two or three reasons in her
      bedroom, caught her attention. She looked at it with a dreamy smile for a
      long time, and then turned to the glass. Made curiously happy by what she
      saw there, she kissed her fingers to the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the better prophet,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Connie's advice as to the desirability of a speedy marriage remained
      in her mind. Jimmie with characteristic diffidence had not yet suggested
      definite arrangements. She was gifted with so much insight as to apprehend
      the reasons for his lack of initiative. His very worship of her, his
      overwhelming sense of goddess-conferred boon in her every smile and
      condescension, precluded the asking of favours. So far it was she who had
      arranged their daily life. It was she who had established the custom of
      the studio visits, and she had taken off her hat and had inaugurated the
      comedy of the domestic felicities of her own accord. She treasured this
      worship in her heart as a priceless thing, all the more exquisite because
      it lay by the side of the knowledge of her own unworthiness. The sacrifice
      of maidenly modesty in proposing instead of coyly yielding was at once a
      delicious penance for hypocritical assumption of superiority, and a salve
      to her pride as a beautiful and desirable woman. It was with a glorious
      sureness of relation, therefore, that she asked him the next day if he had
      thought of a date for their marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason for a long engagement that I can see,&rdquo; she added, with
      a blush which she felt, and was tremulously happy at feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was waiting for you to say, dear,&rdquo; he replied, his arm around her. &ldquo;I
      dared not ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed the deep laugh of a woman's happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would say that,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Let it be some time next
      month.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVI&mdash;EARTH AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE day Norma
      received a polite intimation from her bankers that her account was
      overdrawn. This had happened before but on previous occasions she had
      obtained from her father an advance on her allowance and the unpleasant
      void at the bank had been filled. Now she realised with dismay that the
      allowance had been cut off, and that no money could come into her
      possession until the payment of the half-yearly dividend from the concern
      in which her small private fortune was invested. She looked in her purse
      and found five shillings. On this she would have to live for three weeks.
      Her money was in the hands of trustees, wisely tied up by the worldly aunt
      from whom she had inherited it, so that she could not touch the capital.
      While she was contemplating the absurdity of the position, the maid
      brought up a parcel from a draper's on which there was three and eleven
      pence halfpenny to pay. She surrendered four of her shillings, and
      disconsolately regarded the miserable one that remained. The position had
      grown even more preposterous. She actually needed money. She had not even
      the amount of a cab-fare to Friary Grove. She would not have it for three
      weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preposterous or not, the fact was plain, and demanded serious
      consideration. She would have to borrow. The repayment of the loan and the
      overdraft would reduce the half-yearly dividend. A goodly part of the
      remainder would be required to meet an outstanding milliners' bill, not
      included in the bridal trousseau for which her father was to pay. The sum
      in simple arithmetic frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am poverty-stricken,&rdquo; she said to Connie, to whom she confided her
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie blotted the cheque that was to provide for immediate wants, and
      laughed sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to learn to be economical, dear. I believe it's quite easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean I must go in omnibuses and things?&rdquo; said Norma, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not order so many hats and gowns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Norma, folding up the cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      With money again in her pocket, she felt lighter of heart, but she knew
      that she had stepped for a moment out of fairyland into the grey world of
      reality. The first experience was unpleasant. It left a haunting dread
      which made her cling closer to Jimmie in the embrace of their next
      meeting. It was a relief to get back into the Garden of Enchantment and
      leave sordid things outside. Wilfully she kept the conversation from
      serious discussion of their marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When next she had occasion to go to the studio, she remembered the
      necessity of economy, and took the St. John's Wood omnibus. As a general
      rule the travellers between Baker Street station and the Swiss Cottage are
      of a superior class, being mostly the well-to-do residents in the
      neighbourhood and their visitors; but, by an unlucky chance, this
      particular omnibus was crowded, and Norma found herself wedged between a
      labouring man redolent of stale beer and bad tobacco, and a fat Jewish
      lady highly flavoured with musk. A youth getting out awkwardly knocked her
      hat awry with his elbow. It began to rain&mdash;a smart April shower. The
      wet umbrella of a new arrival dripped on her dress while he stood waiting
      for a place to be made for him opposite. The omnibus stopped at a
      shelterless corner, the nearest point to Friary Grove. She descended to
      pitiless rain and streaming pavements and a five minutes' walk, for all of
      which her umbrella and shoes were inadequate. She vowed miserably a
      life-long detestation of omnibuses. She would never enter one again. Cabs
      were the only possible conveyances for people who could not afford to keep
      their carriage. She fought down the dread that she might not be able to
      afford cabs. The Almighty, who had obviously intended her to drive in
      cabs, would certainly see that His intentions were carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived at the studio, wet, bedraggled, and angry; but Jimmie's
      exaggerated concern disarmed her. It could not have been less had she
      wandered for miles and been drenched to the skin and chilled to the bone.
      He sent Aline to fetch her daintiest slippers to replace the damp shoes,
      established the storm-driven sufferer in the big leathern armchair with
      cushions at her back and hassocks at her feet, made a roaring fire and
      insisted on her swallowing cherry brandy, a bottle of which he kept in the
      house in case of illness. In the unwonted luxury of being loved and petted
      and foolishly fussed over, Norma again forgot her troubles. Jimmie
      consoled the specific grievance by saying magniloquently that omnibuses
      were the engines of the devil and vehicles of the wrath to come. With a
      drugged economic conscience she went home in a cab. But the conscience
      awoke later, somewhat suffering, and she recognised that her exasperated
      vow had been vain. Jimmie was a poor man. She recalled to mind his words
      on the night of their engagement, and apprehended their significance. The
      trivial incident of the omnibus was a key. The abandonment of cabs and
      carriages meant the surrender of countless luxuries that went therewith.
      Her own two hundred a year would not greatly raise the scale of living.
      She was to be a poor man's wife; would have to wear cheap dresses, eat
      plain food, keep household books in which pennies were accounted for; hers
      would be the humdrum existence of the less prosperous middle class. The
      first pang of doubt frightened her for a while and left her ashamed. Noble
      revolt followed. Had she not renounced the pomps and vanities of a world
      which she scorned? Had not this wonderful baptism of love brought New
      Birth? She had been reborn, a braver, purer woman; she had been initiated
      into life's deeper mysteries; her soul had been filled with joy. Of what
      count were externals?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening Connie Deering gave a small dinner-party in honour of the
      two engagements. Old Colonel Pawley, charged under pain of her perpetual
      displeasure not to reveal the secret of Norma's whereabouts, was invited
      to balance the sexes. He was delighted to hear of Norma's romantic
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can still present the fan,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his soft palms together;
      &ldquo;but I'm afraid I shall have to write a fresh set of verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better give Norma a cookery-book,&rdquo; laughed Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a beautiful one of my own in manuscript which no publisher will
      take up,&rdquo; sighed Colonel Pawley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norma, who had been wont to speak with drastic contempt of the amiable old
      warrior, welcomed him so cordially that he was confused. He was not
      accustomed to exuberant demonstrations of friendship from the beautiful
      Miss Hardacre. At dinner, sitting next her, he enjoyed himself enormously.
      Instead of freezing his geniality with sarcastic remarks, she lured him on
      to the gossip in which his heart delighted. When Connie rallied her,
      later, on her flirtation with the old man, she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember I've been a prisoner here. He's one of the familiar faces from
      outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although jestingly, she had spoken with her usual frankness, and her
      confession was more deeply significant than she was aware at the time. She
      had welcomed Colonel Pawley not for what he was, but for what he
      represented. As soon as she was alone she realised the moral lapse, and
      rebuked herself severely. She was sentimental enough to hang by a ribbon
      around her neck the simple engagement ring which Jimmie had given her, and
      to sleep with it as a talisman against evil thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent the following evening at the studio, heroically enduring the
      discomforts of the detested omnibus. When she descended she drew a breath
      of relief, but felt the glow that comes from virtuous achievement. Jimmie
      was informed of this practice in the art of economy. He regarded her
      wistfully. There were times when he too fought with doubts,&mdash;not of
      her loyalty, but of his own honesty in bringing her down into his humble
      sphere. Even now, accustomed as he was to the adored sight of her there,
      he could not but note the contrast between herself and her surroundings.
      She brought with her in every detail of her person, in every detail of her
      dress, in every detail of her manner, an atmosphere of a dainty, luxurious
      life pathetically incongruous with the shabby little house. He had not
      even the wherewithal to call in decorators and upholsterers and make the
      little house less shabby. So when she spoke of practising economy, he
      looked at her wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eyes are open, dear, are n't they?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You really do realise
      what a sacrifice you are making in marrying me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By not marrying you,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I should have gained the world and
      lost my own soul. Now I am doing the reverse.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her finger-tips lover-wise. &ldquo;I am afraid I must be the devil's
      advocate, and say that the loss and gain need not be so absolutely
      differentiated. I want you to be happy. My God! I want you to be happy,&rdquo;
       he burst out with sudden passion, &ldquo;and if you found that things were
      infinitely worse than what you had expected, that you had married me in
      awful ignorance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She covered his lips with the palm of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go on. You pain me. You make me despise myself. I have counted the
      cost, such as it is. Did I not tell you from the first that I would go
      with you in rags and barefoot through the world? Could woman say more?
      Don't you believe me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe you,&rdquo; he replied, bowing his head. &ldquo;You are a
      great-hearted woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She unfastened her hat, skewered it through with the pins, and gave it him
      to put down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember my Solomon,&rdquo; she said, trying to laugh lightly, for there had
      been a faint but disconcerting sense of effort in her protestation.
      &ldquo;'Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred
      there with.' Besides, you forget another important matter. I am now a
      homeless, penniless outcast. I am not sacrificing anything. It is very
      kind of you to offer to take me in and shelter me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are sophistries,&rdquo; said Jimmie, with a laugh. &ldquo;You gave up all on my
      account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am really penniless,&rdquo; she said, ignoring his argument. &ldquo;<i>Anch' io
      son pittore</i>. I too have felt the pinch of poverty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She revealed her financial position&mdash;the overdraft at the bank, the
      shilling between herself and starvation. Were it not for Connie, she would
      have to sing in the streets. She alluded thoughtlessly, with her class's
      notions as to the value of money, to her &ldquo;miserable two hundred a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred a year!&rdquo; cried Jimmie. &ldquo;Why, that's a fortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone struck a sudden chill through her. He genuinely regarded the
      paltry sum as untold riches. She struggled desperately down to his point
      of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it may come in useful for us,&rdquo; she said lamely.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;I should think
      it will! Why did n't you tell me before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never thought I might have a little of my own?&rdquo; she asked with a
      touch of her old hardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see any 'of course' in the matter. The ordinary man would have
      speculated&mdash;it would have been natural&mdash;almost common-sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie threw up his hands deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been too much dazzled by the glorious gift of yourself to think of
      anything else you might bring. I am an impossible creature, as you will
      find out. I ought to have considered the practical side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am very glad you did n't!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Heaven forbid you should
      have the mercenary ideas of the average man. It is beautiful to have
      thought of me only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I was thinking of myself, my dear,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I must get out
      of the way of it, and think of the two of us. Now let us be severely
      business-like. You have taken a load off my mind. There are a thousand
      things you can surround yourself with that I imagined you would lack.&rdquo; He
      took her two hands and swung them backwards and forwards. &ldquo;Now I shan't
      regard myself as such a criminal in asking you to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think two hundred a year a fortune, Jimmie?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Rothschilds and Vanderbilts perhaps not&mdash;but everything is
      relative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her heart spoke suddenly, demanding relief. Their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One thing at least is absolute.&rdquo; An interlude of
      conviction succeeded doubt. She felt that she had never loved him so much
      as at that moment. It was more with the quickly lit passion of the
      awakened woman than with the ardour of a girl that she clasped her hands
      round his head and drew it down to their kiss. She had an awful need of
      the assurance of the absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      It nerved her to face a discussion on ways and means with Aline, whom
      Jimmie at her request summoned from demure sewing in her little
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she had said, referring to his former remark. &ldquo;We ought
      to be severely business-like. I must begin to learn things. You don't know
      how hopelessly ignorant I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline came down to give the first lesson in elementary housekeeping. She
      brought with her a pile of little black books which she spread out at the
      end of the long table. The two girls sat side by side. Jimmie hovered
      about them for a while, but was soon dismissed by Aline to a distant part
      of the studio, where, having nothing wherewith to occupy himself, he
      proceeded to make a charcoal sketch of the two intent faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aline, proud at being able to display her housewifely knowledge before
      appreciative eyes, opened her books, and expounded them with a charming
      business air. These were the receipts for the last twelve months; these
      the general disbursements. They were balanced to a halfpenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course anything I can't account for, I put down to the item 'Jimmie,'&rdquo;
       she said naively. &ldquo;He <i>will</i> go to the money-drawer and help himself
      without letting me know. Is n't it tiresome of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma smiled absently, wrinkling her brows over the unfamiliar figures.
      She had no grasp of the relation the amounts of the various items bore to
      one another, but they all seemed exceedingly small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's necessary to make up this annual balance?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Otherwise you would n't know how much you could apportion to
      each item. Jimmie says it's nonsense to keep books; but if you listen to
      Jimmie, you 'll have the brokers in in a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brokers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aline laughed at her perplexed look. &ldquo;Yes, to seize the furniture in
      payment of debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The main financial facts having been stated, Aline came to detail. These
      were the weekly books from the various tradesmen. She showed a typical
      week's expenditure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the fishmonger?&rdquo; asked Norma, noting an obvious omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish is too expensive to have regularly,&rdquo; Aline explained, &ldquo;and so I
      don't have an account. When I buy any, I pay for it at once, in the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When <i>you</i> buy it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. You'll find it much better to go and choose things for yourself
      than let them call for orders. Then you can get exactly what you want,
      instead of what suits the tradesman's convenience. You see, I go to the
      butcher and look round, and say 'I want a piece of that joint,' and of
      course he does as he's told. It seems horrid to any one not accustomed to
      it to go into a butcher's shop, I know; but really it's not unpleasant,
      and it's quite amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should n't your housekeeper do the marketing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she does sometimes,&rdquo; Aline admitted; &ldquo;but Hannah is n't a good buyer.
      She can't <i>judge</i> meat and things, you know, and she is apt to be
      wasteful over vegetables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't bring the&mdash;the meat and things&mdash;home with you in a
      basket, do you?&rdquo; asked Norma, with a nervous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie, interested in his sketch, had not listened to the conversation,
      which had been carried on in a low tone. The last words, however, pitched
      higher, caught his ear. He jumped to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norma carry home meat in a basket! Good God! What on earth has the child
      been telling you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said anything of the kind, Jimmie,&rdquo; cried Aline, indignantly.
      &ldquo;You needn't bring home anything unless you like; our tradesmen are most
      obliging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma pushed back her chair from the table and rose and again laughed
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I can't learn all the science of domestic economy in one
      lesson. I must do it by degrees.&rdquo; She passed her hand across her forehead.
      &ldquo;I'm not used to figures, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie looked reproachfully at Aline. &ldquo;Those horrid little black books!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed. &ldquo;They are enough to give any one a headache. For heaven's
      sake, have nothing to do with them, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the brokers will come in,&rdquo; said Norma, with an uncertain catch in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are Aline's pet hobgoblins,&rdquo; laughed Jimmie. &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo;
       pointing to the books, &ldquo;please take those depressing records of wasted
      hours away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone, he said to Norma very tenderly, &ldquo;I am afraid my
      little girl has frightened you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started at the keenness of his perception and flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so proud of the way she runs her little kingdom here,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;so proud to show you how it is done. You must forgive her. She is only a
      child, my dearest, and forgets that these household delights of hers may
      come as shocks to you. I shall not allow you to have these worries that
      she loves to concern her head about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who will have them?&rdquo; she asked, with her hand on the lapel of his
      jacket. &ldquo;You? That would be absurd. If I am your wife, I must keep your
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Jimmie, kissing her, &ldquo;if we love each other, there will be
      no possibility of worries. I believe in God in a sort of way, and He has
      not given you to me to curse and wither your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could only bless and sanctify it,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, dear; but our love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soothed, she raised a smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still, I'll have to keep house. Do you think I would let you go to
      the butcher's? What would Aline say if you made such a proposal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would peremptorily forbid him to take my orders,&rdquo; he replied,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I should,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was growing late. She glanced at the wheezy tilted old Dutch clock in
      the corner, and spoke of departure. She reflected for a moment on the
      means of home-getting. To her lowered spirits the omnibus loomed like a
      lumbering torture-chamber. The consolation of a cab seemed cowardice. An
      inspiration occurred to her. She would walk; perhaps he would accompany
      her to Bryanston Square. He was enraptured at the suggestion. But could
      she manage the distance?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to try. I am a good walker&mdash;and when we are outside,&rdquo;
       she added softly, &ldquo;we can talk a little of other matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a mild spring night, and the quiet stars shone benignantly upon
      them as they walked arm in arm, and talked of &ldquo;other matters.&rdquo; As she had
      needed a little while before the assurance of the absolute, so now she
      craved the spirituality of the man himself, the inner light of faith in
      the world's beauty, the sweetness, the courage&mdash;all that indefinable
      something in him which raised him, and could alone raise her, above the
      terrifying things of earth. She clung to his arm in a pathos of yearning
      for him to lead her upward and teach her the things of the spirit. Only
      thus lay her salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, clean, simple soul, lost in the splendour of their love, expounding,
      as it chanced, his guileless philosophy of life and his somewhat
      childishly pagan religious convictions, was far from suspecting the battle
      into which he was being called to champion the side of righteousness. He
      went to sleep that night the most blissfully happy of men. Norma lay
      awake, a miserable woman.

      Chapter XXVII&mdash;A DINNER OF HERBS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>HE loved him. Of
      that there was no doubt. To her he was the man of men. The half angel,
      half fool of her original conception had melted into an heroic figure
      capable of infinite tendernesses. The lingering barbaric woman in her
      thrilled at the memory of him contemptuously facing death before the
      madman's revolver. Her higher nature was awed at the perfect heroism of
      his sacrifice. She knelt at his feet, recognising the loftier soul. Sex
      was stirred to the depths when his arms were about her and his kiss was on
      her lips. In lighter relations he was the perfect companion. For all her
      vacillation, let that be remembered: she loved him. All of her that was
      worth the giving he had in its plenitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days which followed her initiation into domestic economy were days of
      alternating fear and shame and scornful resolution. She lost grip of
      herself. The proud beauty curving a contumelious lip at the puppet show of
      life was a creature of the past. Set the proudest and most self-sufficing
      of women naked in what assembly you please, and she will crouch, helpless,
      paralysed, in the furthest corner. Some such denudation of the moral woman
      had occurred in the case of Norma Hardacre. The old garments were stripped
      from her. She was bewildered, terrified, no longer endowed with
      personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes despising herself and resolved to perform her manifest duty, she
      sought other lessons from Aline. They ended invariably in dismay. Once she
      learned that Jimmie had never had a banking account. The money was kept in
      a drawer of which Jimmie and Aline had each a key. On occasions the drawer
      had been empty. Another lesson taught her that certain shops in the
      neighbourhood were to be avoided as being too expensive; that cream was
      regarded as a luxury, and asparagus as an impossible extravagance. Every
      new fact in the economy of a poor household caused her to shiver with
      apprehension. All was so trivial, so contemptibly unimportant, and yet it
      grew to be a sordid barrier baffling her love. She loathed the base
      weakness of her nature. It was degrading to feel such repulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Connie Deering was going to a Foreign Office reception, and
      came down an enchanting vision in a new gown from Paquin and exhibited
      herself to Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's rather a success. Don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma assented somewhat listlessly, but to please her friend inspected the
      creation and listened to her chatter. She was feeling lonely and
      dispirited. At Aline's entreaty she had persuaded Jimmie to go with Tony
      Merewether to the Langham Sketch Club, thus showing himself, for the first
      time since the scandal, among his old associates. For her altruism she
      paid the penalty of a dull evening. Their visits to each other were her
      sole occupation now, all that was left in life to interest her. In moments
      of solitude she began to feel the appalling narrowness of the circle in
      which she was caged. Reading tired instead of refreshing her. She had been
      accustomed to men and women rather than to books, to the sight of many
      faces, to the constant change of scene. When she speculated on employment
      for future solitary hours, she thought ruefully of recuffing shirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie apologised for leaving her, hoped she would manage to amuse
      herself. Norma, who had made strenuous efforts to hide the traces of
      tumult, returned a smiling answer. Connie, quite deceived, put an arm
      round her waist and said suddenly in her bright, teasing way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't you wish you were coming too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma, staggered at the point-blank question, was mistress enough of
      herself to observe the decencies of reply, but when Connie had gone, she
      sat down on the sofa and stared in front of her. She did wish she were
      going with Connie. She had been wishing vaguely, half-consciously all the
      evening. Now the wish was the pain of craving. It came upon her like the
      craving of the alcoholic subject for drink&mdash;this sudden longing for
      the glitter, the excitement, the whirl of the life she had renounced. Her
      indictment of it seemed unreal, the confused memory of a brain-sick mood.
      It was her world. She had not cut herself free. All the fibres of her body
      seemed to be rooted in it, and she was being drawn thither by irresistible
      desire. The many, many people, the diamonds, the brilliance, the flattery,
      the envy, the very atmosphere heavy with many perfumes&mdash;she saw and
      felt it all; panted for it, yearned for it. That never, never again would
      she take up her birthright was impossible. That she should stand
      forevermore in the humble street outside the gates of that dazzling,
      wonderful, kaleidoscopic world was unthinkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered her talk with Morland at the Duchess of Wiltshire's
      reception at the end of the last season, her shiver at the idea of a life
      of poverty; was it a premonition? She remembered the blessed sense of
      security when she had looked round the splendid scene and felt that she
      and it were indissoluble parts of the same scheme of things. A crust and
      heel of cheese as Jimmie's wife had crossed her mind then as a grotesque
      fantasy; the air of that brilliant gathering was the breath of her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the grotesque fancy was to be the reality; the other was to become
      the shadow of a dream. No yearning or panting could restore it. The
      impossible was the inevitable. The unthinkable was the commonplace. She
      had made her choice deliberately, irrevocably. She had lost the whole
      world to gain her own soul. In the despair of her mood she questioned the
      worth of the sacrifice. The finality of the choice oppressed her. If at
      this eleventh hour she could still have the opportunity of the heroic&mdash;if
      still the gates of the world were open to her, she would have had a
      stimulus to continued nobility. The world and the passionate love for the
      perfect man&mdash;which would she choose? Her exaltation would still have
      swept her to the greater choice. Of, this she was desperately aware. But
      the gates were shut. She had already chosen. The heroic moment had gone.
      The acceptance of conditions was now mere uninspired duty. She gave way to
      unreason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! Why cannot I have both&mdash;my own love and my own life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears she shed calmed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she felt ill from the strain, paying the highly bred woman's
      penalty of nervous break-down. Connie Deering noted the circles beneath
      her eyes and the pinched nostrils. Norma casually mentioned a night's
      neuralgia. It would pass off during the day. She refused to be doctored.
      She would pay a visit to Jimmie before lunch. The fresh air would do her
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fresh air and Jimmie,&rdquo; laughed her friend. &ldquo;You are the most
      beautifully in love young woman I have ever met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma started on her visit, walking fast. At Baker Street station it began
      to rain. She took the penitential omnibus; but her thoughts were too
      anxious to concern themselves with its discomforts. Besides, it was almost
      empty. The night had brought counsel. She would go to Jimmie and be her
      true self, frank and unsparing. With a touch of her old scorn she had
      resolved to confess unreservedly all the meanness and cowardice of which
      she had of late been guilty. She would bare to him the soon spotted soul
      and crave his cleansing. He would understand, pardon, and purify. Perhaps,
      when he knew all, he would be able to devise some new scheme of existence.
      At any rate, she would no longer receive his kisses with a lie in her
      heart. She loved him too ardently. He should know what she was, what were
      her needs, her limitations. The meeting would be a crisis in their lives.
      Out of it would come reconstruction on some unshakable basis. Up to a
      certain point she reasoned; beyond it, the pathetic unreason of a woman
      drifted rudderless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had stopped raining when she left the omnibus and started on the short
      walk from the corner to Friary Grove. At the familiar gate her heart
      already seemed lighter; she opened it, mounted the front steps, and rang.
      The middle-aged servant, minus cap and with thin untidy hair, in a soiled
      print dress, her sleeves rolled up to the elbow exposing red coarse arms,
      was the first shock to Norma when the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both the Master and Miss Aline are out, Miss,&rdquo; said Hannah, with a
      good-natured smile. &ldquo;He has gone into town on business, and Miss Aline,
      went out a little while ago with her young man. But they'll be back for
      lunch. Won't you come in and wait, Miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma, vaguely resenting the familiar address of the servant and her
      slatternly appearance, hesitated for a moment before deciding to enter.
      Hannah showed her into the drawing-room and retired. It was a small dark
      room looking on to the back. Part of it had been cut off when the house
      had been altered, so as to construct the studio staircase, which contained
      one of the original windows. Norma felt strangely ill at ease in the room.
      The prim, cheap furniture, the threadbare carpet, the flimsy girlish
      contrivances at decoration, gave the place an air of shabby gentility. The
      gilt mirror was starred with spots and had a crack across the corner. Some
      of Jimmie's socks and underwear lay on the table for mending. They were
      much darned, and fresh holes could not fail to meet the eye that rested
      but momentarily on the pile. To mend these would in the future be her
      duty. She took up an undervest shrinkingly and shook it out; then folded
      it again and closed her eyes.... She could not wait there: the gloom
      depressed her. The studio would be brighter and more familiar. She went
      downstairs. Nothing in the room she knew so well was changed, yet it
      seemed to wear a different aspect. The homely charm had vanished. Here,
      too, shabbiness and poverty stared at her. The morning light streaming
      through the great high window showed pitilessly the cracks and stains and
      missing buttons of the old leathern suite, and the ragged holes in the
      squares of old carpet laid upon the boards. It was a mere bleak workshop,
      not a room for human habitation. The pictures on the walls and easels
      ceased to possess decorative or even intimate value. The large picture of
      the faun that had exercised so great an influence upon her had been
      despatched to its purchaser, and in its place was a hopeless gap.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down in her accustomed chair, and once more strove to realise the
      future. There would be children who would need her care. On herself would
      all the sordid burdens fall. She saw herself a soured woman, worn with the
      struggle to make ends meet, working with her hands at menial tasks. The
      joy of Life! She laughed mirthlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, walked restlessly about the studio, longing for Jimmie to come
      and exorcise the devils that possessed her. A little sharp cry of distress
      escaped her lips. The place echoed like a vault, and she felt awfully
      alone. In her nervous tension she could bear it no longer. She went up the
      stairs again into the bare hall. On the pegs hung two or three discoloured
      hats and an old coat. Scarce knowing whither she went, she entered the
      dining-room. Luncheon had been laid. A freak of destiny had reproduced the
      meal of which Morland had spoken at Wiltshire House and of which last
      night had revived the memory: a scrag end of cold boiled mutton, blackened
      and shapeless, with the hard suet round about it; a dried-up heel of
      yellow American cheese; the half of a cottage loaf. The table-cloth&mdash;it
      was Friday&mdash;was stained with a week's meals. It was coarse in
      texture, old and thin and darned. The enamel on the plates was cracked,
      the hundred tiny fissures showing up dark brown. The plate on the forks
      had worn off in places, disclosing the yellowish metal beneath. The
      tumblers were thick and common, of glass scarcely transparent. She stared
      helplessly at the table. Never in her life had she seen such preparations
      for a meal. To the woman always daintily fed, daintily environed, it
      seemed squalor unspeakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank back into the hall, pressed her hands to her eyes, looked
      round, as if to search for some refuge. The stairs met her eye. She had
      never seen what lay above the ground floor&mdash;except once, on the
      memorable evening when Aline had fainted. Suddenly madness seized her&mdash;an
      insane craving to spy out the whole nakedness of the house. The worn
      stair-carpet ended at the first landing. Then bare boards. The door of the
      bathroom was wide open. She peeked in. The ceiling was blackened with gas;
      the bath cracked and stained; the appointments as bare as those in a
      workhouse. Her glance fell upon a battered tin dish holding an
      uncompromising cube of yellow soap with hard sharp edges. She withdrew her
      head and shut the door hurriedly. Another door stood ajar. She pushed it
      open and entered. It was the front bedroom&mdash;inhabited by Jimmie. The
      thought that it would be her own, which a fortnight before might have
      clothed her in delicious confusion, chilled her to the bone. Bare boards
      again; a strip of oil-cloth by the narrow cheap iron bedstead; a painted
      deal table with a little mirror and the humblest of toilette equipments
      laid upon it; a painted deal chest of drawers with white handles; a
      painted deal wash-stand; a great triangular bit broken out of the mouth of
      the ewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was poverty&mdash;grinding, sordid, squalid poverty. From the one
      dishevelled, slatternly, middle-aged servant to the cheap paper peeling
      off the wall in the bedrooms, all she had seen was poverty. The gathering
      terror of it burst like a thunderstorm above her head. Her courage failed
      her utterly. Like a creature distracted, she rushed downstairs and fled
      from the house. She walked homewards with an instinctive sense of
      direction. Afterwards she had little memory of the portion of the road she
      traversed on foot. She moved in a shuddering nightmare. All the love in
      the world could not shed a glamour over the nakedness of the existence
      that had now been revealed to her in its entire crudity. She could not
      face it. Other women of gentle birth had forsaken all and followed the men
      they loved; they had loved peasants and had led great-heartedly the
      peasant's life. They had qualities of soul that she lacked. Hideously
      base, despicably cowardly she knew herself to be. It was her nature. She
      could not alter. The world of graceful living was her world. In the other
      she would die. He had warned her. The gipsy faith in Providence had made
      him regard as a jest what would be to her a sordid shift, an intolerable
      ugliness, stripping life of its beauty. The passion-flower could not
      thrive in the hedge with the dog-rose. It was true&mdash;mercilessly true.
      The craving of last night awoke afresh, imperiously insistent. She walked
      blindly, tripped, and nearly fell. A subconscious self hailed a passing
      hansom and gave the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would become of her she knew not. She thought wildly of suicide as
      the only possible escape. From her own world she was outcast. Its gates
      were barred with gold and opened but to golden keys. She was penniless. In
      this other world she would die. Love could not prevent her starving on its
      diet of herbs. She clung to life, to the stalled ox, and recked little of
      the hatred; but at the banquet she no longer had a seat. She had said she
      would follow him in rags and barefoot over the earth. She had not fingered
      the rags when she had made the senseless vow; she had not tried her tender
      feet on the stones. She could have shrieked with terror at the prospect.
      There was no way out but death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Garden of Enchantment faded from her mind like a forgotten dream. The
      sweet Arcadian make-believe alone rose up in ironical mockery, a scathing
      memory which seemed to flay the living heart of her. She sat huddled
      together in a corner of the cab, tortured and desperate. On either hand
      hung the doom of death. In the one case it would be lingering: the soul
      would die first; the man she loved would be tied to a living corpse; she
      would be a devastating curse to him instead of a blessing. In the other
      she could leave him in the fulness of their unsullied love. The years that
      the locust hath eaten would not stretch an impassable waste between them.
      In his sorrow there would be the imperishable sense of beauty. And for
      herself the quick end were better.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aroused to consciousness of external things by a husky voice
      addressing her from somewhere above her head. The cab had stopped at
      Connie's house in Bryanston Square. She descended, handed to the man the
      first coin in her purse that her fingers happened to grasp. He looked at
      it, said that he was sorry he had not change for a sovereign. She waved
      her hand vaguely, deaf to his words. The cabman, with a clear conscience,
      whipped up his horse smartly and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      A figure on the doorstep raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful of you to arrive at the very moment, Miss Hardacre! I am
      summoned back to America. I sail to-morrow. I was calling on the chance of
      being able to bid you good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norma collected her scattered wits and recognised Theodore Weever. She
      looked at him full in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips were parted; her breath came fast. He stretched out his hand to
      press the electric button, so as to gain admittance to the house. She
      touched his arm, restraining his action, and still stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am honoured,&rdquo; he replied in his imperturbable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you found your decorative wife, Mr. Weever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden light shone lambently in his pale, expressionless blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that I can find her on Mrs. Deering's doorstep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you look hard enough,&rdquo; said Norma.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and shook it with the air of a man concluding a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sure of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I intended from the first to marry you. I
      shall ever be your most devoted servant.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make one condition,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't enter this house, and I sail with you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What train shall I catch and from what station shall I start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ten o'clock from Waterloo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I trouble you to book my passage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be my happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>,&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat and walked away briskly. The door opened, and Norma
      entered the house.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVIII&mdash;THE WORD OF ALINE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      |WHAT she wrote to him is no great matter.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Her letter, which he opened on coming down to breakfast the next morning,
      filled many pages. It was a rhapsody of passionate love and
      self-abasement, with frantic appeals for forgiveness. In its cowardice
      there was something horribly piteous. Jimmie read it beneath the high
      north window of the studio, his back turned towards Aline, who was seated
      at the breakfast-table at the other end. For a long, long while he stood
      there, quite still, holding the letter in his hand. Aline, in wonder,
      stole up quietly and touched his arm. When he turned, she saw that his
      face was ashen-grey, like a dead man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock left its mark upon him. Physically it accomplished the work of
      ten years, wiping the youth from his face and setting in its stead the
      seal of middle age. It is common enough for grief or illness to lay its
      hand on the face of a woman no longer young and shrivel up her beauty like
      a leaf and set her free, old and withered. But with a man, who has no such
      beauty to be marred, the case is rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week he remained silent. The two women who loved him waited in
      patience until the time should come for their comforting to be of use.
      From the very first morning he let no change appear in his habits, but set
      his palette as usual and went on with the new picture that was nearing
      completion. In the afternoon he went for a walk. Aline, going down to the
      studio, happened to look at his morning's work. For a moment she was
      puzzled by what she saw, for she was familiar with his methods. Gradually
      the solution dawned upon her. He had been painting meaninglessly,
      incoherently, putting in splotches of colour that had no relation to the
      tone of the picture, crudely accentuating outlines, daubing here, there,
      and anywhere with an aimless brush. It was the work of a child or a
      drunken man. Aline cast herself on the model-platform and cried till she
      could cry no more. When he came back, he took a turpentine rag and
      obliterated the whole picture. For days he worked incessantly, trying in
      vain to repaint. Nothing would come right. The elementary technique of his
      art seemed to have left him. Aline strove to get him away. He resisted. He
      had to do his day's work, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're not well, dear,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;You will kill yourself if you go
      on like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never heard of work killing a man,&rdquo; he answered. Then after a pause,
      &ldquo;No. It's not work that kills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the sleep that had failed him returned, and he awoke one morning
      free from the daze in the brain against which he had been obstinately
      struggling. He rose and faced the world again with clear eyes. When Aline
      entered the studio to summon him to lunch, she found him painting at the
      unhappy picture with his accustomed sureness of touch. He leaned back and
      surveyed his handiwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to be magnificent, is n't it? What a blessing I wiped out the
      first attempt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this is ever so much better, Jimmie,&rdquo; the girl replied, with tears
      very near her eyes. But her heart swelled with happy relief. The aching
      strain of the past week was over. She had dreaded break-down, illness, and
      permanent paralysis of his faculties. The man she knew and loved had
      seemed to be dead and his place taken by a vacant-eyed simulacrum. Now he
      had come to life again, and his first words sounded the eternal chord of
      hope and faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day onwards he gave no sign of pain or preoccupation. Only the
      stamp of middle age upon his face betrayed the suffering through which he
      had passed. He concerned himself about Aline's marriage. Arrangements had
      been made for it to take place on the same day as that of their elders&mdash;a
      day, however, that Norma had never fixed. The recent catastrophe had
      caused its indefinite postponement. Aline declared herself to be in the
      same position as before, the responsibility of the beloved's welfare being
      again thrust upon her shoulders. She pleaded with her lover for delay, and
      young Merewether, disappointed though he was, acquiesced with good grace.
      At last Jimmie called them before him, and waving his old briar-root pipe,
      as he spoke, delivered his ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo; said he, standing up before them, as they sat together
      on the rusty sofa, &ldquo;you have the two greatest and most glorious things in
      a great and glorious world, youth and love. Don't despise the one and
      waste the other. Get all the beauty you can out of life and you'll shed it
      on other people. You'll shed it on me. That's why I want you to marry as
      soon as ever you are ready. You'll let me come and look at you sometimes,
      and if you are happy together, as God grant you will be, that will be my
      great happiness&mdash;the greatest I think that earth has in store for me.
      I have stood between you long enough&mdash;all that is over. I shall miss
      my little girl, Tony. I should be an inhuman monster if I didn't. But I
      should be a monster never before imagined by a disordered brain if I found
      any pleasure in having her here to look after me when she ought to be
      living her life in fulness. And that's the very end of the matter. I speak
      selfishly. I can't help it. I have a great longing for joy around me once
      more. Go upstairs and settle everything finally between you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had gone, he sighed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;a great longing
      for joy&mdash;and the sound of the steps of little children.&rdquo; Then he
      laughed, calling himself a fool, and went on with his painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two afterwards Connie Deering, who had been a frequent visitor
      since Norma's flight, walked into the studio while Jimmie was working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let me disturb you. Please go on,&rdquo; she cried in her bright, airy
      way. &ldquo;If you don't, I'll disappear. I've only come for a gossip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie drew a chair near the easel and resumed his brush. She
      congratulated him on the picture. It was shaping beautifully. She had been
      talking about it last night to Lord Hyston, who had promised to call at
      the studio to inspect it. Lord Hyston was a well-known buyer of modern
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is stocking a castle in Wales, which he never goes near, with acres
      of paint,&rdquo; she said encouragingly. &ldquo;So I don't see why you should n't
      have a look in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a family ghost in the castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe there are two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a blessing,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;Some one, at any rate, will look at the
      pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched him in silence for a minute or two. Then she came to the
      important topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the two children have made up their minds at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are to be married on the twenty-eighth of May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor young things,&rdquo; said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said 'with a sigh. &ldquo;The subject of marriage always
      makes me sad nowadays. I am growing old and pessimistic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are bewilderingly youthful,&rdquo; replied Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how old I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten how to do subtraction,&rdquo; he said, thinking of his own
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Of course you know. It's awful. And Aline is&mdash;what&mdash;seventeen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be dreadfully lonely without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonely? Oh, no. I have my thoughts&mdash;and my memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him fleetingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought you would wish to escape from memories, Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The sorrow's crown of sorrows.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe in it,&rdquo; he said, turning towards her. &ldquo;What has been has
      been. A joy that once has been is imperishable. Remembering happier things
      is a sorrow's crown of consolation. Thank God! I have had them to
      remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she is finding consolation in memories?&rdquo; She spoke with
      sudden heat, for Norma's conduct had filled her heart with blazing
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Jimmie dreamily, after a pause. &ldquo;But she has not so many
      as I. She loved me deeply. She had her hour&mdash;but I had my day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, I should want never to think of her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you were I, my dear Connie,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;If either of us was
      in the wrong, it was not she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; said Mrs. Deering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is the truth. She was made for kings' palaces and not for this
      sort of thing. I knew it was impossible from the first&mdash;but the joy
      and wonder of it all blinded my eyes. She gave me the immortal part of
      herself. It is mine for all eternity. I wrote to her a day or two ago&mdash;I
      was not able at first. I could not sleep, you know; something seemed to
      have gone wrong with my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wrote to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell her not to be unhappy for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have forgiven her entirely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since our love is unchanged, how could I do otherwise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she has gone and thrown herself into the arms of another man&mdash;and
      such a man!&rdquo; said Connie, brusquely. A quiver of pain passed over his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are things of the flesh that the discipline of life teaches a man
      to subdue. I think I am man enough for that. The others are things of the
      spirit. If ever woman loved a man, she loved me. I thank God,&rdquo; he added in
      a low voice, &ldquo;that she realised the impossibility before we were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I; devoutly,&rdquo; said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have made all the difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would have been chained hand and foot to an intolerable existence.
      She would have fretted and pined. Her life would have been an infinite
      burden. Heaven's mercy saved her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was n't looking at it from her point of view at all,&rdquo; exclaimed Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hers is the only one from which one can look at it,&rdquo; he answered gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she bade him good-bye some ten minutes later, she did not withdraw
      the hand which he held. Her forget-me-not eyes grew pleading, and her
      voice trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could comfort you, Jimmie&mdash;not only now, but in the lonely
      years to come. But remember, dear, there is nothing on earth I would n't
      give you or do for you&mdash;nothing on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not till long afterwards that he fully comprehended the meaning of
      her words; and then she herself prettily vouchsafed the interpretation.
      For immediate answer he kissed her on the cheek in the brotherly fashion
      in which he had kissed her twice before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What greater comfort,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can I have than to hear you say that? I
      am a truly enviable man, Connie. Love and affection are showered upon me
      in full measure. Life is very, very sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next two or three weeks brought pleasant surprises which strengthened
      his conviction. One by one old friends sought him out, and, some heartily,
      others shamefacedly, extended to him the hand of brotherhood. His evening
      at the Langham Sketch Club had inaugurated the new order of things. The
      Frewen-Smiths, whose New Year party had marked the epoch between child and
      woman in Aline's life, invited the two outcasts to dinner, and pointedly
      signified that they were the honoured guests. Brother artists looked in
      casually on Sunday evenings. Their wives called upon Aline, offering
      congratulations and wedding-gifts. A lady whose portrait he had painted,
      and at whose house he had visited, commissioned him to paint the portraits
      of her two children. The ostracism had been removed. How this had been
      effected Jimmie could not conjecture; and Tony Merewether and Connie
      Deering, who were the persons primarily and independently responsible, did
      not enlighten him. By Aline's wedding-day all the old circle had gathered
      round him, and a whisper of the true story had been heard in Wiltshire
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the world began to smile upon him, as if to make amends for the
      anguish it could not remedy. He took the smile as a proof of the world's
      essential goodness. The great glory that for a day had made his life a
      blaze of splendour had faded; the sun in his heaven had been eternally
      eclipsed. But the lesser glory of the moon and stars remained undimmed;
      the tenderness of twilight lost no tone of its beauty. He stood unshaken
      in his faith, unchanged in himself&mdash;the strong, wise man looking upon
      the earth and the fulness thereof with the unclouded eyes of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man whom he had most loved, the woman he had most worshipped, had each
      failed him, had each brought upon him bitter and abiding sorrow. They had
      passed like dead folks out of his daily life. Yet each retained in his
      heart the once inhabited chambers. They were dear ghosts. His incurable
      optimism in this wise brought about its consolation. For optimism involves
      courage of a serene quality. Aline, with her swift perception of him, had
      the opportunity of flashing this into an epigram. There was a little
      gathering in the studio, and the talk ran on personal bravery. Some one
      started the question: What would the perfectly brave man do if attacked
      unarmed by a man-eating tiger?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what Jimmie would do,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He would try to pat the beast
      on the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was laughter over the girl's unchallenged championship, but those
      who had ears to hear found the saying true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before the wedding the two sat up very late, spending their last
      hours together, and Aline sat like a child on Jimmie's knee and sobbed on
      his breast. The lover seemed a far-away abstraction, a malevolent force
      rather than a personality, that was tearing her away from the soil in
      which her life was rooted. Jimmie stroked her hair and spoke brave words.
      But he had not realised till then the wrench of parting. Till then,
      perhaps, neither had realised the strength of the bond between them. They
      were both fervent natures, who felt intensely, and their mutual affection
      had been a vital part of their lives. If bright and gallant youth had not
      flashed across the girl's path and, after the human way, had not caught
      her wondering maidenhood in strong young arms; if deeper and more tragic
      passion had not swept away the mature man, it is probable that this rare,
      pure love of theirs might have insensibly changed into the greater need
      one of the other, and the morrow's bells might have rung for these two.
      But as it was, no such impulse stirred their exquisite relationship. They
      were father and daughter without the barrier of paternity; brother and
      sister without the ties of consanguinity; lovers without the lovers'
      throb; intimate, passionate friends with the sweet and subtle magic of the
      sex's difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bear leaving you,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I can't bear leaving the dear
      beautiful life. I'll think of you every second of every minute of every
      hour sitting here all alone, alone. I don't want to go. If you say the
      word now, I'll remain and it shall be as it has been for ever and ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall miss you&mdash;terribly, my dear,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I'll be the
      gainer in the end. You'll give me Tony as a sort of younger brother. I am
      getting to be an old man, darling&mdash;and soon I shall find the need of
      <i>les jeunes</i> in my painting life. You can't understand that yet. Tony
      will bring around me the younger generation with new enthusiasms and fresh
      impulses. It is to my very great good, dear. And if God gives you
      children, I'll be the only grandfather they'll ever have, poor things, and
      I'd like to have a child about me again. I have experience. I have washed
      your chubby face and hands, <i>moi qui vous parle</i>, and undressed you
      and put you to bed, my young lady who is about to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jimmie, I remember it&mdash;and I had to tell you how to do
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems the day before yesterday,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;<i>Eheu fugaces!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day when she in her wedding-dress (a present from Connie Deering)
      walked down the aisle on her husband's arm and stole a shy glance at him,
      radiant, full of the promise and the pride of manhood, and met the glad
      love in his eyes, she forgot all else in the throbbing joy of her young
      life's completion. It was only afterwards when she was changing her dress,
      with Connie Deering's assistance, in her own little room, that she became
      again conscience-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>will</i> look after Jimmie while I am away, <i>won't</i> you?&rdquo; she
      asked tragically&mdash;they were going to the Isle of Wight for their
      honeymoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would look after him altogether if he would let me,&rdquo; said Connie, in an
      abrupt, emotional little outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aline drew a quick breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie threw the simple travelling-hat, whose feathers she was daintily
      touching, upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think I mean?&rdquo; she laughed nervously. &ldquo;I'm not an old woman.
      I'm as lonely as Jimmie will be&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;-only I've found out that I love Jimmie as much as a silly
      woman can love anybody, if it's any satisfaction to you to know it&mdash;and
      you may be quite sure I'll see that no harm comes to him during your
      honeymoon, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ensuing conversation nearly caused the bride to miss her train. But no
      bride ever left her girlhood's room more luminously happy. On the
      threshold she turned and threw her arms round Connie Deering's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll arrange it all when I come back,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Aline kept her word.
    </p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
